At this time of the year, attention to charitable giving is more important than ever because there are so many individuals who have suffered from disasters this year; others continue to face economic challenges and still others just need a helping hand during the holiday season. Here\u2019s how your business can help those in need, and what you can gain tax wise.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EGiving cash\u003C\/strong\u003E\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ECash donations, which includes donations by check, credit cards, and electronic transfers, is the most common type of donations.

Cash donations are deductible by those who itemize up to 50% of adjusted gross income.

You can, for example, dispose of excess or obsolete inventory (that still has value), which is still very useful to a charity. Tax-wise, your donation is limited to your tax basis (typically your cost) if the fair market value of the property is greater.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EC corporations. \u003C\/em\u003EDonations of inventory items to a charity that cares for the ill, the needy, or infants receives an enhanced donation.

While you can\u2019t require them to use the time for charitable purposes, you can encourage them to do so. For employment tax purposes, this paid time off is treated as any other compensation.\u003C\/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EYou cannot deduct the value of your time. So, for example, if you have an electrical business and do wiring for a local charity, you cannot deduct what you would have charged for labor.

Set up an in-house fund to which employees can donate their unused vacation, sick, and personal days. These unused days can then be used by an employee in need.

However, from time to time the IRS let\u2019s employers donate the unused leave time to charities benefiting victims from specific disasters, such as the \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/uac\/irs-provides-special-relief-to-encourage-leave-based-donation-programs-for-victims-of-louisiana-flooding\u0022\u003ELouisiana floods\u003C\/a\u003E \u00a0and \u003Ca href=\u0022https:\/\/www.irs.gov\/uac\/newsroom\/irs-provides-special-relief-to-encourage-leave-based-donation-programs-for-victims-of-hurricane-matthew\u0022\u003EHurricane Matthew\u003C\/a\u003E this year.

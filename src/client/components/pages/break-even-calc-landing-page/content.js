    question: 'Use the break-even formula',
    answer: `
      <p>This break-even analysis is based on the foundation of a single product or service.</p>
      <p>
        To calculate the break-even point in units we use the formula: <br/>
        <strong>Break-even point (units) = fixed costs ÷ (sales price per  unit – variable cost per unit) </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Or in sales dollars using the formula:<br/>
        <strong>Break-even point (sales dollars) = fixed costs ÷ contribution margin</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Contribution Margin is the difference between the price of a product and what it costs to make that product.<br/>
        The calculation is as follows:<br/>
        <strong>Contribution margin = (sale price per unit – variable cost per unit) ÷ sale price per unit</strong>
      </p>`

    question: 'Calculate multiple products or services',
    answer: `
      <p>
        The total fixed costs, variable costs, unit or service sales are calculated on a monthly basis in this calculator. Meaning that adding the total for all products and services monthly should account for all products and services. You may also want to do the calculation individually for each product or service if the products or service sales vary per month.
      </p> 
      <p>
        Remember the break-even point is used as an estimate for lender viability and your business plan. 
        It is not intended to 100% accurately determine your accounting or financing since those calculations 
        can only be done after all costs and production have occurred. It's also a good idea to throw a little 
        extra, say 10%, into your break-even analysis to cover miscellaneous expenses that you can't predict.

    question: 'Learn about variable costs',
    answer: `
      <p>
        Variable costs are costs that change in proportion to production output. Variable costs 
        increase or decrease depending on a company's production volume; they rise as production increases 
        and fall as production decreases. It is a constant amount per unit produced.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Examples of variable costs include the costs of raw materials and packaging. For this calculator
        we are calculating the variable costs based on the number of units sold. Variable costs can change 
        with many different factors throughout a company’s lifecycle. In the break-even analysis we will help 
        you break down the potential variable costs related to your business.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Examples of variable costs include:</strong>
        <ul>
          <strong>
            <li>Cost of raw materials</li>
            <li>Packaging</li>
            <li>Shipping</li>
            <li>Direct labor</li>
            <li>Utilities</li>
            <li>Commissions</li>
          </strong>
        </ul>

    question: 'Learn about semi-variable costs',
    answer: `
     <p>Sometimes determining whether a cost is fixed or variable is more complicated. </p>
     <p>
      There is also a category of costs that falls in between, known as semi-variable costs 
      (also known as semi-fixed costs or mixed costs). These are costs composed of a mixture of both 
      fixed and variable components. Costs are fixed for a set level of production or consumption and 
      become variable after this production level is exceeded. If no production occurs, a fixed cost is 
      often still incurred.
     </p>
     <p>
      The best way to include these costs is to separate out the part that is variable from the part 
      that is fixed. These may include minimum payments or fees for services and products. For the break-even 
      analysis to be as accurate as possible it is important to separate any semi-variable costs into their 
      fixed and variable parts if possible. 
     </p>
      <p><strong>Examples of semi-variable costs include:</strong></p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <strong>
            <li>Monthly telephone services</li>
            <li>Repairs</li>
            <li>Indirect materials</li>
            <li>Indirect labor</li>
            <li>Fuel</li>
            <li>Power</li>
          </strong>

    question: 'Use the break-even formula',
    answer: `
      <p>
        To calculate the break-even point in units we use the formula: <br/>
        <strong>break-even point (units) = fixed costs ÷ (sales price per unit – variable costs
        per unit)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Or in sales dollars using the formula:<br/><strong> break-even point (sales dollars) = 
        fixed costs ÷ contribution margin.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Contribution Margin</strong> is the difference between the price of a product 
        and what it costs to make that product.
        The calculation is as follows:<br/>
        <strong>(sale price per unit – variable costs per unit)/sale price per unit</strong>
      </p>`

    question: 'Calculate multiple products or services',
    answer: `
      <p>
        <strong>The total fixed costs, variable costs, unit or service sales are calculated 
        on a monthly basis in this calculator.</strong> 
        Meaning that adding the total for all products and services monthly should account 
        for all products and services. You may also want to do the calculation individually 
        for each product or service if the products or service sales vary per month. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember the break-even point is used as an estimate for lender viability and your 
        business plan. It is not intended to 100% accurately determine your accounting or 
        financing since those calculations can only be done after all costs and production 
        have occurred.

    question: 'Learn about fixed costs',
    answer: `
    <p>
      <strong>Fixed costs</strong> are costs incurred during a specific period of time 
      that do not change with the increase or decrease in production or services. Once 
      established, fixed costs do not change over the life of an agreement or cost schedule. 
      For this calculator we are calculating the fixed costs on a monthly basis. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have fixed costs that do not incur monthly you should still include them, but calculate the monthly amount that goes towards that expense. For example if something is paid for on a quarterly basis, but does not change with production you would divide that cost by 4 in order to estimate the monthly amount of that cost. In the break-even analysis we will help you break down the potential fixed costs related to your business.
    </p> 
    <p>
      <strong>Examples of fixed costs include:</strong>
      <ul>
        <strong>
          <li>Rental lease payments</li>
          <li>Salaries</li>
          <li>Property taxes</li>
          <li>Insurance</li>
          <li>Interest</li>
          <li>Depreciation</li>
        </strong>
      </ul>
    </p>`

  {
    question: 'Learn about variable costs',
    answer: `
      <p>
        <strong>Variable costs</strong> are costs that change in proportion to production 
        output. Variable costs increase or decrease depending on a company's production 
        volume; they rise as production increases and fall as production decreases. It 
        is a constant amount per unit produced.
      </p>

      <p>
        Examples of variable costs include the costs of raw materials and packaging. 
        For this calculator we are calculating the variable costs based on the number of 
        units sold. Variable costs can change with many different factors throughout a 
        companies lifecycle. In the break-even analysis we will help you break down the 
        potential variable costs related to your business.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Examples of variable costs include:</strong>
        <ul>
          <strong>
            <li>Cost of raw materials</li>
            <li>Packaging</li>
            <li>Shipping</li>
            <li>Direct labor</li>
            <li>Utilities</li>
            <li>Commissions</li>
          </strong>
      </ul>
    </p>`

    question: 'Learn about semi-variable costs',
    answer: `
      <p>
        There is also a category of costs that falls in between, known as semi-variable 
        costs (also known as semi-fixed costs or mixed costs). These are costs composed of 
        a mixture of both fixed and variable components. Costs are fixed for a set level of 
        production or consumption and become variable after this production level is exceeded. 
        If no production occurs, a fixed cost is often still incurred.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best way to include these costs is to separate out the part that is variable from 
        the part that is fixed. These may include minimum payments or fees for services and 
        products. For the break-even analysis to be as accurate as possible it is important 
      <p>Sometimes determining whether a cost is fixed or variable is more complicated.</p>
      to separate any semi-variable costs into their fixed and variable parts if possible. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>Examples of semi-variable costs include:</strong></p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <strong>
            <li>Monthly telephone services</li>
            <li>Repairs</li>
            <li>Indirect materials</li>
            <li>Indirect labor</li>
            <li>Fuel</li>
            <li>Power</li>
          </strong>

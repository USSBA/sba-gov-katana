# Link

Use this component anywhere you would use [React Router's](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) `<Link>`. This component provides a simple wrapper that pre-checks a link's url, and if the url's location should be handled by server routing, it uses [a small hack](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/issues/3109#issuecomment-189782650) to bypass client routing and send a request to the server.

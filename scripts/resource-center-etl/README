# Resource Center ETL Script

This script will take the "CSV" files of the resource center locations and convert them into a single JSON file.

## Usage

Drop files in ./raw-data/

```
.
├── raw-data
│   ├── PrtData.txt
│   ├── SBDC.txt
│   ├── SCORE.txt
│   ├── VET.txt
│   └── WBC.txt
└── rc-etl.js
```

Then run `node rc-etl.js`

Output will be `./output.json`

This file should be moved to `src/client/services/resource-centers.json`

## Input Formats

### SBDC, SCORE, VET, WBC

This is the ordered list of column names, renamed for convenience:

> ["Validprtprimcattyp","Validprtsubcattyp","Prtid","id","name1","name2","Validloctyp","street1","street2","city","state","zip","Geolattude","Geolngtude","phone","Fax","Web","Email","Lastupdtdt"]

### PrtData

The example file given did not provide a header, so some assumptions were made regarding column content.  For the purpose of this script, we can ignore the fields not pertaining to address/phone

> ["ignore1","ignore2","ignore3","ignore4","ignore5","name1","name2","ignore6","street1","street2","city","state","zip","ignore7","ignore8","phone","fax","ignoreTheRest"];//,"","N","N","Y","Y","N","N","N","N","N","N","N","N","N","N","N","N","N","N","N","N","N","N"]

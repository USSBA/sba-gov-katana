They consider how each name will look on signs and in advertisements. They ultimately choose the name \u201cJ\u0026K Auto Repair.\u201d It\u2019s professional, personal (using the first initial of each of their first names), and straightforward.\r\n\r\nA quick online search shows that no nearby businesses have a similar name. But John and Kelly don\u2019t want to infringe on any existing trademark, which could cause them legal trouble. They use the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s trademark search tool and learn that the name \u2014 or any variation of it \u2014 is not trademarked, so they\u2019re free to use it.\r\n\r\nNow that they\u2019ve picked a name for the business, they start to build its presence online. John and Kelly create a Facebook page for their business, adding the address, hours, and phone number, as well as photos of the building.\r\n\r\nJohn and Kelly\u2019s auto repair shop has a unique name that potential clients can easily find online."

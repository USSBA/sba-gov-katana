Welcome to SBA's ANC Business Guide. &nbsp;A guide to the 8(a) Business Development Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 2 Introduction</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;8(a) Business Development Program is designed to assist socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses, including ANC owned businesses<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Designed to inform, educate and engage qualified businesses in the 8(a) program</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 8(a) program is a business development program designed to assist socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses, including ANC owned enterprises.<br />\r\nThis guide is designed to inform, educate and engage qualified ANC owned businesses in the 8(a) program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 3 Course Contents ANC Business Guide</strong><br />\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Alaska Native Corporation (ANC)<br />\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;8(a) Program Purpose &amp; Summary<br />\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How the Program Works<br />\r\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Eligibility Requirements for Tribal Enterprises<br />\r\n5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Application Process<br />\r\n6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Key Questions &amp; Answers<br />\r\n7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Resources and Assistance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The training module provides an overview of the 8(a) program, including a discussion about ANC owned businesses, a description of the program's purpose, how it works, eligibility requirements, the application process, key questions and answers and important resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition many of the slides include highlighted boxes with specific FAR and CFR regulatory references to help users easily access more information about the content in the slides.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAlso, the course is designed so that you can easily go to, leave or return to any section of the course, at any time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 4 Alaska Native Corporation (ANC)</strong><br />\r\nWhat is an Alaska Native Corporation (ANC)?<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ANC means any Regional Corporation, Village Corporation, Urban Corporation or Group Corporation organized under the laws of the State of Alaska in accordance with the Alaska Native Claims Act, as amended by 43 U.S.C 1601, et seq.<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Indian tribe means any Indian tribe, band, nation or other organized group or community of Indians, including any ANC, which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians or is recognized as such by the State in which the tribe, band, nation or community resides</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But first, what is an Alaska Native Corporation (ANC)?<br />\r\nANC means any Regional Corporation, Village Corporation, Urban Corporation or Group Corporation organized under the laws of the State of Alaska in accordance with the Alaska Native Claims Act, as amended by 43 U.S.C 1601.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition and as defined in federal regulations, a tribally owned business (concern) means any business (concern) that is at least 51% owned by an Indian tribe. An Indian tribe is any Indian tribe, band, nation or other organized group or community of Indians, including any ANC, which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians or is recognized as such by the State in which the tribe, band, nation or community resides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 5 Business Development Growth</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business growth graphic…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 8(a) program is a tool, a business development tool that may fit within the economic development vision of the ANC or the business entities that make up the ANC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that said, successful business development within a tribe may be enhanced with a well- defined economic development framework and a strong foundational base of capabilities, strategies and supporting policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the base sits nation building. A strong, effective, self-driven nation serves as the foundation to support all productive activity. Resting above it, is economic development. In this level, a nation builds the capacity to identify, select and manage the community's endowment of resources and talent that help achieve the community's vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the top is business development growth. Here ANC entities make critical decisions on starting and growing their businesses. The 8(a) program is but one tool that may help support business development growth.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Slide 6 Framework for Business Development Growth</strong><br />\r\nAssess -What we know<br />\r\nStrategic choices - Identify opportunities<br />\r\nCapabilities - Alignment and delivery<br />\r\nAction - Adapting and learning<br />\r\nMobilization - Willingness to lead change</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Achieving business growth requires a plan. &nbsp;A well thought out plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As such, a tribal entity or ANC should have a good understanding of where it is today, where it has been and where it wants to go. &nbsp;Five steps can be applied to build a planning framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, gather what you know and assess your current circumstances. Second, identify opportunities and make strategic choices. Applying to the 8(a) program, for instance, may be one of those choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Third, understand your tribal capabilities and align skills with what your tribe can successfully deliver. &nbsp;Fourth, identify and manage actions and lastly, but most importantly, mobilize change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 7 Structural Options</strong><br />\r\nGraphic of business structural options…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 8(a) program is a business development tool, and an ANC may have more than one related 8(a) business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important for an ANC to understand how it can be optimally structured so it can be positioned for business development growth. This slide shows one structural option, with two related 8(a) firms and one non-8(a) business, organized through a holding company owned by the ANC. &nbsp; There are other options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 8 Reflection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does your Alaska Native Corporation have a strong foundational base for economic development? Has ANC leadership considered ways the 8(a) program can be used as a business development tool? Is your ANC structurally positioned for optimal business development growth?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 9 8(a) Program &amp; Summary</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 10 Program Purpose</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Help small disadvantaged businesses, including ANC owned businesses compete in the marketplace</li>\r\n\t<li>Provide business development support</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Prepare qualifying entities for procurement and other business opportunities</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 8(a) Program -- named for Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act - is designed to assist small disadvantaged businesses, including ANC owned businesses to compete in the marketplace. It is also designed to assist such entities in gaining access to federal and private procurement markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary focus of the program is to provide business development support, such as mentoring, procurement assistance, business counseling, training, financial assistance, surety bonding and other management and technical assistance to qualified firms. The ultimate objective, however, is to prepare small disadvantaged firms for procurement and other business opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the award of sole source and set-aside contracts, the 8(a) program provides market access and growth for qualified tribal enterprises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 11 Alaska Native Corporation 8(a) Perspective</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;8(a) program is a business development tool for ANCs<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Federal agencies have strong incentives to contract with tribal concerns and ANC owned businesses<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tribes do have special procurement privileges - an important perspective is that often times proceeds from tribally owned companies are used to benefit the entire ANC membership, rather than individual owners</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The program is a business development tool that offers opportunities for small businesses owned by tribes, Alaska Native Corporations and other qualifying entities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the 8(a) program, Congress granted such entities with unique rights in the federal procurement process. These rights provide federal agencies with strong incentives to contract with businesses owned by ANCs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tribes and ANCs do have special procurement privileges. There are many reasons for this. However, an important perspective is that often times the proceeds from tribally or ANC owned companies are used for the benefit of the entire tribal membership, rather than individual owners. Tribes and ANCs use these proceeds to build, sustain and operate their communities - for the betterment of education, health care, public works and other community sustaining activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 12 Regulatory Guidance</strong><br />\r\nThe 8(a) Business Development Program:<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Established by:<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act of 1953<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Governed by:<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;13 CFR 124.100-124.704 (Subpart A)<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;FAR Part 19.800-19.812<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Specific References to Tribally Owned Businesses:<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;13 CFR 124.3 -- Definitions<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;13 CFR 124.103 -- Who is socially disadvantaged?<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;13 CFR 124.105-106 -- Eligibility<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;13 CFR 124.109 -- Applying to the 8(a) program<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;13 CFR 124.112 -- Business criteria to remain eligible</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The 8(a) program was established by Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act.</strong><br />\r\nIt is primarily governed by 13 CFR 124 Subpart A and FAR Parts 19.8 - 19.812. Specific references to tribally owned businesses are also noted in the slide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 13 Key Program Objectives</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"Promote the business development of small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals…\"<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"Promote the competitive viability of such concerns…\"<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\"Clarify and expand the program for procurement by the United States…\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As articulated in statute and regulations, the key objectives of the 8(a) program are to promote business development of small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals; to promote the competitive viability of such concerns; and to use the tools of the program to help qualified small disadvantaged firms benefit from federal procurement opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Qualifying ANC owned businesses can benefit from these key program objectives. Slide 14 Term of Participation</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Maximum 9 year participation in the program, beginning from the date of SBA approval</li>\r\n\t<li>First 4 years are considered the developmental stage</li>\r\n\t<li>Last 5 years are considered the transitional stage</li>\r\n\t<li>Continuation in the program is dependent on:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Remaining eligible as a socially and economically disadvantaged firm (includes all applicable requirements)</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Staying in compliance with the 8(a) BD participation agreement</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Participation in the 8(a) program is limited to 9 years, beginning from the date a firm is approved by the SBA as a certified 8(a) Business Development firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first four years in the program are considered the developmental stage. The last five years in the program are considered the transitional stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuation in the program, in both the developmental and transitional stages, is dependent on the firm's continuing eligibility as a socially and economically disadvantaged - owned and operated - firm and that the firm continues to be in compliance with the 8(a) business development agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 15 Summary Requirements and Goals</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Overall goal for 8(a) firms is to graduate from the program and thrive in a competitive business environment</li>\r\n\t<li>Requirements:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Maintain a balance between commercial and government business</li>\r\n\t\t<li>SBA district offices monitor and measure the progress of participating firms</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Annual review</li>\r\n\t<li>Business planning</li>\r\n\t<li>Systematic evaluations</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The 8(a) program is a business development program. As such, the overall goal for 8(a) firms is to graduate from the program and go-on to thrive in a competitive business environment. There are several requirements in place to help firms achieve this goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firms must maintain a balance between their commercial and government business</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, SBA district offices monitor and measure the progress of participating 8(a) firms. It does this through annual reviews, business planning collaboration and systematic evaluations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 16 Reflection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is the purpose of the 8(a) program aligned with the goals and objectives of your Alaska Native Corporation? Is your ANC and related ANC businesses positioned to take advantage of opportunities available through the 8(a) program?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 17 How the 8(a) Program Works</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 18 Driven by Several Key Components</strong><br />\r\nSBA's role<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Business development assistance<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Business development support<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Contract opportunities<br />\r\nRole of the tribal 8(a) program participant<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Capitalize on available business development assistance and support<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Learn about government buying needs<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Market to the government<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Submit information annually to the SBA to prove eligibility</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The program is driven by several key components. SBA plays a pivotal role, but the core of the program is focused on business development assistance, business development support, finding contract opportunities and marketing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important role, however, is played by 8(a) firms themselves. Each of these components is explained in the following sections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 19 SBA's Role</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Program policy guidance</li>\r\n\t<li>Review and certify eligible clients</li>\r\n\t<li>Assign SBA personnel, Business Opportunity Specialists, to 8(a) participating firms</li>\r\n\t<li>Provide business development assistance</li>\r\n\t<li>Help identify contract opportunities for 8(a) participating entities</li>\r\n\t<li>Review progress of 8(a) certified businesses and tribal concerns</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>As the administrator of the program, SBA provides program policy guidance, reviews and certifies eligible clients, assigns SBA personnel -- Business Opportunity Specialists -- to approved 8(a) entities, provides business development assistance, helps in identifying potential contract opportunities and reviews the progress of participating 8(a) concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA's role is to build a strong resource-rich program -- that helps 8(a) certified, ANC owned businesses to become and remain competitive in the economic mainstream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 20 Business Development Assistance</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Business counseling and mentoring<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Online and traditional training<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Surety bond guarantees<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Contract marketing guidance<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Acquire federal government surplus property<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Other management and technical assistance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aiding 8(a) certified, ANC owned enterprises with business development assistance is core to the program. This assistance takes many forms, but includes, business counseling and mentoring; online and traditional training; surety bond guarantees; contract marketing guidance; acquiring federal government surplus property; and, other forms of management and technical assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Competitive strength comes from knowledge, financial support and technical assistance - all of which can be gained through SBA's business development initiatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 21 Business Development Support</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Helping firms:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>register in the System for Award Management (SAM)</li>\r\n\t\t<li>find contract opportunities</li>\r\n\t\t<li>maintain a current business plan with a procurement strategy</li>\r\n\t\t<li>and other support</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Working with agencies and prime contractors to direct contracts to small firms</li>\r\n\t<li>Assigning Business Opportunity Specialists(BOS)s to work individually with participating 8(a) firms</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Providing management, technical and financial assistance is one aspect of the program. Another key dimension is providing business development support to 8(a) clients.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nImportantly, SBA also works with federal agencies and prime contractors ---- encouraging them to set aside, breakout or otherwise make contracts available to 8(a) and other small firms. In other words, SBA markets the technical capabilities of small businesses to federal buying entities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, each 8(a) firm is assigned a Business Opportunity Specialist by the SBA. The assigned specialist helps guide the 8(a) business during its tenure in the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 22 Contract Opportunities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>SBA staff and Procurement Center Representatives (PCRs) work closely with government and private organizations to identify procurement opportunities for small firms</li>\r\n\t<li>Government-wide procurement goals that benefit small businesses</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;23% -- Overall small business goal<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5% -- Small disadvantaged businesses<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5% -- Women owned small businesses<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3% -- Certified HUBZone firms<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3% -- Service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The federal government buys in excess of $600 billion dollars in goods and services each year. Government-wide procurement goals help define another aspect of the 8(a) program. Such goals establish procurement targets for agencies that benefit small disadvantaged businesses and other small firms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA personnel, specifically Procurement Center Representatives, work closely with government and private organizations to identify procurement opportunities for small businesses and to help target specific acquisitions for 8(a) participating firms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, government policy and SBA staff encourage federal agencies to meet or exceed annual small business procurement goals. The current government-wide goal for prime and subcontracts to small disadvantaged businesses is 5%. Overall, however, the government-wide small business goal for all prime contracts is 23%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other government-wide procurement goals include: 5 percent of prime and subcontracts for women-owned small businesses; 3 percent of prime and subcontracts for Hubzone businesses and &nbsp;3 percent of prime and subcontracts for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 23 Role of 8(a) ANC Owned Businesses</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>SBA opens the door….</li>\r\n\t<li>8(a) client firms must be competitive and market themselves competitively</li>\r\n\t<li>Successful 8(a)tribal firms capitalize on available business development resources, educate themselves on government buying needs, and market themselves based on skills and ability to meet such needs</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, in describing how the program works, the most important role is played by the 8(a) firms, themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA may be able to open some doors, but it is up to the tribal 8(a) firms in the program to be competitive and to market themselves effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's all about preparation and self-marketing. Successful 8(a) firms capitalize on available business development resources, educate themselves on government and corporate buying needs, and market themselves based on their skills and ability to support the procurement needs of multiple organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 24 Reflection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can the 8(a) program be used successfully by your Alaska Native Corporation as a business development tool? How can this be accomplished? Importantly, what specific steps should your ANC take to make this happen?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 25 8(a) Program Eligibility for ANC Owned Businesses</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Program eligibility requirements for ANC owned businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 26 Eligibility</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Special rules</li>\r\n\t<li>Tribal / ANC eligibility</li>\r\n\t<li>Business eligibility</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Eligibility for the 8(a) program is uniquely defined for tribal and ANC owned businesses. As such, there are special rules and unique tribal and business eligibility requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 27 Special Rules</strong><br />\r\nSpecial rules<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Initial 8(a) eligibility --- 13 CFR 124.109<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Remaining in the 8(a) program as a participant --- 13 CFR 124.112</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Special rules apply to ANC enterprises regarding both initial 8(a) program eligibility and eligibility to remain in the 8(a) program as a participant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 28 Tribal - ANC Eligibility</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Social disadvantage</li>\r\n\t<li>Economic disadvantage</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>ANC owned businesses, with regard to 8(a) program eligibility, are subject to the same conditions that apply to tribally owned concerns, with some exceptions. The key exceptions deal with proving economic disadvantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 29 Social Disadvantage</strong><br />\r\nAn Indian tribe as defined in 13 CFR 124.3 is considered to be socially disadvantaged<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n\"An Indian tribe means any Indian tribe, band nation or other organized group or community of Indians, including any ANC, which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the U.S. to Indians because of their status as Indians, or is recognized as such by the state in which the tribe, band, nation, group or community resides\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding social disadvantage and for the purposes of the 8(a) program, an Indian tribe or ANC<br />\r\n-- as defined in 13 CFR 124.3 -- is considered to be socially disadvantaged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slid 30 Economic Disadvantage</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Alaska natives and descendents of natives must own a majority of both total equity of the ANC and the total voting powers to elect directors of the ANC through their holdings of settlement common stock</li>\r\n\t<li>Settlement common stock means stock of an ANC issued pursuant to U.S.C. 1606(g)(1)</li>\r\n\t<li>ANC that meets these requirements is deemed economically disadvantaged</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding economic disadvantage, such status is demonstrated when Alaska natives and descendents of natives own a majority of both total equity of the ANC and the total voting powers to elect directors of the ANC through their holdings of settlement common stock. An ANC that meets these requirements is deemed economically disadvantaged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 31 Required Forms and Documents</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>ANC applicant is required to submit all of the same documents generally required by all other 8(a) applicants</li>\r\n\t<li>Other ANC specific documents required include:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Articles of incorporation, including amendments</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Bylaws and amendments</li>\r\n\t\t<li>List of companies in which the ANC has ownership</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>An ANC applicant is required to submit all of the same documents generally required by all other 8(a) applicants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, an ANC owned business is also required to submit additional documentation, including: articles of incorporation, with any amendments; bylaws and amendments; and, a list of all companies in which the ANC has ownership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you are ready, review the hyperlinked ANC checklist for greater clarity regarding required documentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 32 ANC Business Eligibility</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Legal business entity organized for profit</li>\r\n\t<li>Size</li>\r\n\t<li>Ownership</li>\r\n\t<li>Control and management</li>\r\n\t<li>Individual eligibility limitation</li>\r\n\t<li>Potential for success</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\r\nBesides tribal and corporate 8(A) eligibility requirements, there are business eligibility requirements for the 8(a) program that must be complied with as well. These requirements focus on the legal structure of the tribal business, the size of the concern, ownership rights, control and management of the enterprise, individual eligibility limitation and the potential for success of the tribal enterprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 33 Legal Business Entity Organized for Profit</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Alaska Native Corporation can be either for profit or non-profit</li>\r\n\t<li>Affiliated small business owned by the ANC must operate as a \"for profit\" to be eligible for the 8(a) program</li>\r\n\t<li>Firm will be considered owned and controlled by the ANC when both the majority of stock or other ownership interest and total voting power are held by the ANC and holders of the settlement common stock</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>An Alaska Native Corporation can be either for profit or non-profit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the affiliated small business owned by the ANC must operate as a \"for profit\" business to be eligible for the 8(a) program.

An ANC owned applicant must qualify as a small business concern as defined for purposes in 13 CFR 121. The particular size standard to be applied is based on the primary industry classification or NAICS code of the applicant concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, in determining the small business size standard, the ANC owned business will be determined independently without regard to its affiliation with the Alaska Native Corporation, any entity of the ANC governing body, or any other business enterprise owned by the ANC, unless the SBA Administrator determines that one or more such ANC owned businesses have obtained, or are likely to obtain, a substantial unfair competitive advantage within an industry category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 35 Ownership</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>For corporate entities, a tribe must unconditionally own at least 51 percent of the voting stock and at least 51 percent of the aggregate of all classes of stock</li>\r\n\t<li>For non-corporate entities, a tribe must unconditionally own at least 51 percent interest</li>\r\n\t<li>Tribe may not own 51% or more of another firm which, either at the time of application or within the previous two years, has been operating in the 8(a) program under the same primary NAICS code as the applicant</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>With regards to ownership, a tribe must unconditionally own at least 51 percent of the ownership or stock of the business concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A tribe may not own 51% or more of another firm which, either at the time of application or within the previous two years, has been operating in the 8(a) program under the same primary NAICS code as the applicant.

Therefore, an individual responsible for the control and management of an ANC business does not need to establish social and economic disadvantage status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, individuals responsible for the management and daily operations of the business may not manage more than two 8(a) program participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use the regulatory site noted in the slide to gain additional clarity regarding control and management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 37 Individual Eligibility Limitation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Individual eligibility limitation - there is none</li>\r\n\t<li>SBA does not deem an individual involved in the management or daily business operations of a tribally owned business to have used his or her individual eligibility within the meaning of \"one-time eligibility\"</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no individual eligibility limitation.

Verify ANC eligibility compliance<br />\r\nSTEP 2. Gather what you need (supporting documentation)<br />\r\nSTEP 3. Ask questions<br />\r\nSTEP 4. Register in the System for Award Management (SAM)<br />\r\nSTEP 5. Register in SBA's General Login System (GLS)<br />\r\nSTEP 6. Complete and submit the online 8(a) program application</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you feel you are qualified and only when you are ready to apply - should you apply for 8(a) program certification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The application process is not difficult. However, like any important application process it does require solid preparation, meaningful thought and a certain level of due diligence. &nbsp;It makes sense to do it right, the first time. No business wants to waste time and resources going through the motions and then not realizing what is expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, we recommend that six steps be followed in the application process. Each of these steps is discussed in the following.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 43 Step 1 Verify ANC Eligibility Compliance</strong><br />\r\nBefore you begin the application process, verify ANC eligibility requirements:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Must be able to demonstrate social and economic disadvantage by showing majority equity in an ANC owned by Alaska natives and descendants</li>\r\n\t<li>ANC owned business must meet legal, size, ownership, character, management &amp; control and potential for success standards</li>\r\n\t<li>Review 13 CFR 124.109(a)-(c)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNot every business enterprise is eligible for 8(a) program certification. Before you begin the application process, make sure you meet the core ANC eligibility requirements. &nbsp;This is step one.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Slide 44 Step 2 Gather What You Need Learn more about…</strong><br />\r\nAlaska Owned Business Checklist Sample 8(a) Program Application</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 8(a) program is statutorily authorized and specific eligibility requirements are strictly adhered-to and monitored by the SBA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you prepare to apply for 8(a) program certification, you will be asked to provide, identify, demonstrate and validate much information. Therefore, it's important to assemble key ANC, business, governance, ownership, tax and other pertinent information to have readily available during the application process and BEFORE you attempt to complete the electronic 8(a) program application. &nbsp;This is step two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 45 Step 3 Ask Questions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>You don't know what you don't know…</li>\r\n\t<li>Review eligibility requirements, checklist, blank 8(a) program application, documentation you gathered and then --- ASK QUESTIONS</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned earlier, no business wants to waste time and resources going through the motions and then not getting what is expected. That is why step three is critical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You don't know what you don't know. Make a point of becoming informed. Review eligibility requirements, the checklist, blank 8(a) application, documentation you gathered, and then, importantly, ask questions of SBA district office staff and others, experienced and qualified in the 8(a) program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 46 Step 4 Register in SAM Learn more about…</strong><br />\r\nSystem for Award Management (SAM)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step four, register in the System for Award Management.<br />\r\nTo do business with the federal government and to be certified under the 8(a) program, you must register in the System for Award Management or SAM, which is a database and government- wide single point of vendor registration. Within the SAM system, you must also complete the Small Business Supplemental Page. Use the hyperlink to learn more about the SAM system and to register your ANC owned business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 47 Step 5 Access and Register in GLS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step five, access and register in the General Login System.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To apply for 8(a) certification, you must register for an account in SBA's General Log-in System, more commonly referred to as GLS. The GLS system provides a single log-in point for all SBA services. This single-entry point streamlines and simplifies service delivery to our clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To access the 8(a) program electronic application, you will first have to login to SBA's GLS system.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Slide 48 Step 6 Complete and Submit Application</strong><br />\r\nStep 6, complete and submit the 8(a) electronic application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 49 Reflection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is your ANC owned business ready to apply for 8(a) certification? Have you meaningfully considered each of the six 8(a) program application steps?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 50 Key Questions and Answers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 51 FAQs Learn more… 13 CFR 124</strong><br />\r\nAlaska Native Corporation - FAQs 8(a) Program Certification - FAQs Acquire Surplus Property - FAQs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes the best approach to learn about a program is to review frequently asked questions and answers. Several good sources for such information include: 13 CFR 124 -- which is a comprehensive review of the 8(a) program and developed in a question and answer format; Alaska Native Corporation FAQs; 8(a) program certification FAQs; and, FAQs about acquiring surplus property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 52 Reflection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knowledge is power.

Then you will explore whether your business is ready to sell to the federal government, then how to identify if your business is eligible to benefit from the All Small Mentor-Protégé Program. Finally, you will be provided specifics as to how to apply to the All Small Mentor-Protégé Program.<br />\r\nThe estimated time to complete this course is 30 minutes. Once you're finished, you will receive a certificate of completion for the course that you will need to print, scan, and save electronically to upload with your application to the All Small Mentor-Protégé Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Learning Objectives</strong><br />\r\nThis tutorial has four learning objectives:<br />\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Recall how small businesses fit into the federal buying marketplace. &nbsp;2.Recognize whether your business is ready to sell to the federal government. 3.Recognize if your business is eligible for the All Small Mentor-Protégé Program. 4.Be ready to apply for the All Small Mentor-Protégé Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Federal Buying Marketplace</strong><br />\r\nThe U.S. government is the largest single purchaser of goods and services in the world, buying everything from armored tanks to paper clips and IT services. Every year, the federal government awards more than $500 billion in contracts, and a significant share of those contracts are specifically allotted to small businesses. Small business contracting is an important tool that we have at the federal level to help America's small businesses grow and create jobs.<br />\r\nThe U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) was created with the knowledge that small businesses are a critical component to sustaining our economic health and continued growth. The mission of the SBA is to aid, assist, counsel, and protect the interests of the nation's small business community. There are multiple programs and initiatives available to support this effort, including federal government-wide contracting goals and small business \"set-aside\" programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Size Standards, Federal Contracting Goals and \"Set-Asides\"</strong><br />\r\nThe current federal procurement goal aims to award, or \"set-aside,\" at least 23 percent of all government contracting dollars for small businesses. In order to bid for these set- asides, you need to meet the industry size standards established by the SBA to qualify as \"small.\"<br />\r\nPlease select each topic on the left-hand side of the screen to learn more.<br />\r\nSmall Business Defined<br />\r\nFor most industries, the SBA defines a \"small business\" as a business that:<br />\r\n- is organized for profit and is not nationally dominant in its field;<br />\r\n- has a place of business in the U.S.;<br />\r\n- either operates primarily within the U.S. or makes a significant contribution to the<br />\r\nU.S. economy through tax payments or the use of American products, labor, or materials; and<br />\r\n- is independently owned and operated.<br />\r\nSize Standards Tool<br />\r\nThe business may be a sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, or any other legal form. Use our Size Standards Tool www.sba.gov/tools/size-standards-tool to find out if you qualify as a small business. Once you've determined you're a small business, you can then certify your business as small by registering as a government contractor.<br />\r\nFederal Contracting Goal<br />\r\nIn addition to the 23 percent goal, federal government agencies aim to set-aside contracting dollars for the following types of small businesses:<br />\r\n- 5 percent for women-owned small business<br />\r\n- 5 percent for small disadvantaged businesses<br />\r\n- 3 percent for small businesses' located in HUBZones<br />\r\n- 3 percent for service-disabled veteran owned small businesses<br />\r\nSBA Set Aside Programs<br />\r\nThe SBA has outlined several specific certifications that provide qualifying businesses with benefits within the procurement (i.e., contracting) process. These certifications are divided into the following two categories:<br />\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SBA-Certified: 8(a) Business Development Program and the HUBZone Program.<br />\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Self-Certified: Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), and Small Disadvantaged Business (SDB).<br />\r\nAll of these are powerful tools for helping small businesses win federal prime contracts and subcontracts. For more information on qualification criteria for each of these set aside programs, see www.sba.gov/contracting. If government contracting sounds like a logical progression in the development of your business, it might be time to evaluate whether the federal marketplace is right for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Is Your Business a Good Candidate for Federal Government Contracting?</strong><br />\r\nLike starting a business, securing government contracts isn't as simple as just turning the key and opening the doors. As you weigh the decision, consider the following questions:<br />\r\n- What are the characteristics of your product, what's your current market, and does the federal government buy it?<br />\r\n- Do you have a solid accounting system and a stable workforce?<br />\r\n- Are you able to access credit and working capital?<br />\r\n- Do you have good supplier relationships and can you meet government shipping specifications and requirements?<br />\r\n- Have you ever worked with other businesses in teaming agreements or joint ventures, or acted as a supplier to the federal government?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.8&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The All Small Mentor-Protégé Program</strong><br />\r\nSelect Each Number to Learn About The All Small Mentor-Protégé Program.<br />\r\n1<br />\r\nThe All Small Mentor-Protégé Program (MPP) is designed to provide small businesses with business development assistance and to enhance their ability to successfully compete for federal contracts.<br />\r\n2<br />\r\nTo be eligible to participate in the program, you (i.e., the prospective Protégé) must be either a for-profit business or an agricultural cooperative that is considered \"small\" for the NAICS code in which you're requesting a Mentor-Protégé relationship. Additional requirements include:<br />\r\n- You need to have prior experience working in the NAICS code in which you're seeking assistance<br />\r\n- Your Mentor must be organized for-profit and cannot own more than 40% equity in your business<br />\r\n- The SBA has not made a determination of affiliation between you and your Mentor Both you and your Mentor have an active registration in SAM.gov<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nIn addition to the preliminary requirements, there are specific rules governing the program that you should be aware of.<br />\r\n- In general, you (the Protégé) can only have one Mentor at a time, and cannot have more than two mentors across all SBA-administered Mentor-Protégé programs.<br />\r\n- Mentors may have no more than three protégés. The SBA may authorize a small business to be both a Mentor and a Protégé, but only if you can demonstrate that the second relationship won't compete or conflict with the first Mentor-Protégé relationship.<br />\r\n4<br />\r\nThe types of SBA-approved assistance that a Mentor can provide include:<br />\r\n- Management and technical assistance (e.g., HR and accounting systems, manufacturing assistance, and technology transfers)<br />\r\n- Financial assistance (e.g., equity investments or loans)<br />\r\n- Contracting assistance (e.g., contract performance and joint venture agreements)<br />\r\n- Trade education (e.g., identifying markets and export assistance)<br />\r\n- Business development assistance (e.g., business planning, marketing, networking, and relationship building)<br />\r\n- General, and administrative assistance (e.g., daily operations, capacity building, and bonding)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.10&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Benefits of the All Small Mentor-Protégé Program</strong><br />\r\nSelect Each Number to Learn About The Benefits of The All Small Mentor-Protégé Program.<br />\r\n1<br />\r\nMentors can help you grow your networks and challenge you in positive ways that will help your business develop. The key here is, in order to meet the size standards required to get the set-aside, both businesses in the joint venture need to be \"small.\" If either one of the businesses aren't considered \"small\" in the NAICS code they'll be working under the contract and the joint venture won't qualify to win the small business set-aside. This is because of the SBA's rules related to \"affiliation\" that prohibit non-small businesses from entering into a joint venture to bid on small business set-asides.<br />\r\nThese rules are intended to:<br />\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;preclude a small business from leaning too heavily on a larger business in order to win a small business set-aside; and<br />\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;protect a small business from being taken advantage of by a larger business.<br />\r\n2<br />\r\nOne of the most tangible benefits of the All Small MPP is the ability to receive an exclusion from affiliation. This allows a small business to leverage the experience and relationships of a mature company.<br />\r\nSo what is an exclusion from affiliation? To better understand this concept and the benefit, it's important to understand how federal set-aside contracts are bid on and awarded.<br />\r\n3<br />\r\nWhen a federal set-aside contract is made available, qualifying businesses (in this case small businesses) are able to bid on the contract. If the small business lacks the capacity required in the contract, they can enter a joint venture with another small business to supplement their capacity and bid on the contract together.<br />\r\nWith an exclusion from affiliation, a qualifying small business can enter a joint venture agreement with a business of any size. That is, if SBA approves your Mentor-Protégé Agreement, you and your Mentor may joint venture for any small business set-aside that you (the Protégé) qualify for, regardless of your Mentor's size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.11&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What is a Mentor-Protégé Agreement? What Should It Include?</strong><br />\r\nTo be considered for the All Small MPP, you will need to submit a Mentor-Protégé Agreement (MPA) to the SBA. This document is central to your participation in the All Small MPP, and serves as the roadmap for the relationship between you and your Mentor.<br />\r\nPlease select each topic on the left-hand side of the screen to learn more.<br />\r\nWhat is a MPA?<br />\r\nThe Mentor-Protégé Agreement (MPA) should assess your business development needs, specify how your Mentor will address those needs, and set a developmental timeline for the delivery of assistance that the Mentor commits to provide.<br />\r\nA MPA may be approved for three years, with an option to renew for another three years. For example, you (the Protégé) may have two three-year MPAs with different Mentors, and each may be extended an additional three years provided you've received the agreed- upon assistance.<br />\r\nWhat is in a MPA?<br />\r\nAdditionally, the MPA must:<br />\r\n- Address how the assistance to be provided will help you meet the goals defined in your business plan<br />\r\n- Establish a single point of contact within your Mentor's organization who will be responsible for managing and implementing the MPA<br />\r\n- State that your Mentor will provide the agreed upon assistance for at least one year<br />\r\n- Identify how the assistance to be provided differs from any assistance being provided under another Mentor-Protégé relationship (if applicable)<br />\r\n- A statement indicating that either you or your Mentor may terminate the agreement with 30 days' advance notice to the other party, and to the SBA<br />\r\n- A statement specifying that any changes to the agreement must be made in writing, and be approved in advance by the SBA<br />\r\n- The signatures of both you and your Mentor, and the date on which the agreement was signed<br />\r\nApproving a MPA<br />\r\nThe SBA will not approve a MPA unless it determines that the Mentor-provided assistance will promote real developmental gains for your business, and is not merely a vehicle for the Mentor to receive federal small business set-asides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.12&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How Do I Find a Good Mentor?</strong><br />\r\nMentors can help you grow your networks and challenge you in positive ways that will help your business develop.<br />\r\nAs you look to identify a potential Mentor, it's critical that you (the prospective Protégé) do your research. Make sure they have a good reputation and are willing and able to coach and mentor you. If you haven't worked with them before, what do you know about them? If they approached you about a potential Mentor-Protégé relationship, do you know why? Be sure your prospective Mentor is not just looking for access to federal small business set-aside contracts.<br />\r\nYou'll want to know whether they have good supplier relationships and what sort of experience they have working with the federal government. Be clear about what you need from the relationship and be sure it's reflected in any agreement you work out. Above all, make sure that what they're offering matches your needs and that it fits with the growth plan you've mapped out for your business.<br />\r\nTo qualify to participate in the All Small MPP, your prospective Mentor must:<br />\r\n- Be capable of carrying out their responsibilities under the proposed MPA<br />\r\n- Provide value to you (the Protégé) through imparting practical experience and lessons learned, or through their knowledge of business operations and government contracting<br />\r\n- Possess good character</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.13&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Joint Venture Agreements</strong><br />\r\nIf you and your approved mentor decide to form a joint venture to bid on a government contract, there are three points you (the Protégé) should be aware of.<br />\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The joint venture will only qualify for the contracting set-asides that you (the protégé) are eligible for, and any joint ventures must be separately identified with the appropriate DUNS and CAGE numbers in SAM.gov.<br />\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The entity \"Type\" in SAM.gov has to be identified as a joint venture, with the individual joint venture partners listed.<br />\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All joint venture agreements must be in writing, and you (the Protégé) must meet the program-specific requirements for the particular set-aside.<br />\r\nWhile joint venturing is a great opportunity, there is also the risk that another business will protest your joint venture, and you could lose the bid if your joint venture agreement isn't written and structured appropriately. Although the SBA doesn't review or approve joint venture agreements, there is statutory guidance that can help you know what should be included.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.14&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What Should Be in a Joint Venture Agreement? (Statutory Guidance)</strong><br />\r\nHere is a list of the statutory guidance that can help you know what should be included in a joint venture agreement.<br />\r\nSelect each number to learn about what should be in a Joint Venture Agreement.<br />\r\n1<br />\r\nA joint venture should:<br />\r\n- State the purpose of the joint venture<br />\r\n- Designate you (the small business) as the managing venturer, and one of your employees as the project manager responsible for the contract<br />\r\n- State that you (the small business) own at least 51 percent of the joint venture entity, and that your business will receive profits from the joint venture that are commensurate with work performed.<br />\r\n2<br />\r\n- Provide for the establishment and operation of a special bank account in the name of the joint venture that's signed by all parties<br />\r\n- Itemize all major equipment, facilities, and resources to be furnished by each party<br />\r\n- Specify each party's responsibilities with regard to contract negotiations, labor sourcing, and contract performance<br />\r\n- Obligate all parties to ensure that the contract is performed, regardless of whether one party withdraws from the agreement<br />\r\n3<br />\r\n- Designate that the managing venturer is responsible for maintaining accounting and administrative records, and require that they (the managing venturer) keep all original records of the joint venture once the contract is completed<br />\r\n- State that all quarterly financial statements showing cumulative contract receipts and expenditures will be submitted to the SBA within 45 days of the end of each operating quarter of the joint venture<br />\r\nFor additional guidance on the contents of a joint venture agreement, please review the rules and regulations listed in the 13 CFR 125.8.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.15&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Applying to the All Small MPP</strong><br />\r\nIf you meet the preliminary criteria and are ready to apply to the All Small MPP, there are some documents that you'll need to gather.<br />\r\nPlease select on each topic on the left-hand side of the screen to learn more.<br />\r\nCertificate of Completion<br />\r\nFirst and foremost, you'll need to print out the certificate of completion once you've finished this tutorial. You'll also want to ask your mentor to watch the tutorial, and to provide you with their certificate of completion so that both documents can be electronically uploaded into your application.<br />\r\nElectronic Documents<br />\r\nNext, you'll need to gather electronic copies of:<br />\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Your completed business plan.<br />\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Any active Mentor-Protégé Agreements (MPA) you have with either SBA or another federal agency.<br />\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A SBA size redetermination letter if the SBA has ever found you to be \"other than small\" in the NAICS code in which you're requesting business development assistance.<br />\r\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The proposed Mentor-Protégé Agreement.<br />\r\nNAICS Code<br />\r\nOnce you've compiled these materials, you'll want to make sure that you're registered in SAM.gov for the NAICS code in which you're requesting business development assistance. This is a critical step, and SBA cannot approve any MPAs if the requested NAICS code (either your primary or secondary) isn't reflected in SAM.gov.<br />\r\nIf you need to add or revise the codes that are listed there, please make the change and wait at least 24 hours before entering that information into your MPP application to make sure the information has been updated. Finally, you'll need your Mentor's DUNS number.<br />\r\nReady to Apply<br />\r\nYou're now ready to apply!<br />\r\nThe application is available electronically, and can be completed and submitted via Certify.SBA.gov. When you enter the site, you'll be asked a series of questions to determine your eligibility for the program, and there will be prompts asking you to upload electronic copies of all required documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.17&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Resources</strong><br />\r\nSBA has a broad network of skilled counselors and business development specialists.

Our communities can be very different from each other.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economic development is important. It keeps us together as a community. It keeps our culture alive. It helps to strengthen our government.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And since each of our communities are different, the economic and business development plans and approaches may be different as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Photo of Native woman holding a small picture of pottery&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Successful Business Development Growth&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Successful business development growth may be enhanced with a well-defined economic development framework and a strong foundational base of capabilities, strategies, and supporting policies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the base sits Nation building. A strong, effective, self-driven Nation serves as the foundation to support all productive activity.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Resting above it, is Economic Development.

We ask: What results are we achieving? What are our strengths and weaknesses? What are our opportunities and what are our threats?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that understanding, we create strategic choices. Here, we set the grand direction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once we know where we are going, we align everyone and everything to move in the same direction. This is what we call “Capable Institutions”.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sustained action is next. In this step, we create an action plan. We set up specific actions, priorities, responsible parties and time schedules. And last, we mobilize around the action plan. Leaders step forward and employees commit to moving forward.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These are the five steps to economic development.

A weakness may hinder it, for example, the absence of a UCC code.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An opportunity is something outside a community, such as a growing demand in tourism, that moves you toward your vision.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A threat is something external that obstructs that movement.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Development: Strategic&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Making Strategic Choices&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-SMART GOALS&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Specific&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Measurable&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Attainable&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Realistic&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-Timely&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image of circular development layout: Action, Mobilize, Access, Strategic, Capabilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diagram of Five Step process with focus on step 2 Strategic. Identify opportunities within the environment?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once we have completed an assessment of where we are, we move to the next step.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The community or business makes strategic choices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here, we choose the grand direction we want to go.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We may also articulate a series of goals that support our strategy. The goals should follow a SMART framework of being specific, measureable, attainable, realistic and timely.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Development: Strategic&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four Strategic Choices&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>• Vision&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>• Advantages&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>• Industry opportunities&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>• Economic development&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>approaches&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image of circular development layout: Action, Mobilize, Access, Strategic, Capabilities. Photo of Native woman holding pottery.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diagram of Five Step process with focus on step 2 Strategic.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like a potter, a community or business shapes its future by the strategic choice they make.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Development: Strategic&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developing a Vision&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The vision of a tribal community is a shared picture of its preferred future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The practical vision of a community is held, to varying degrees, by all of its members, providing a common focus and direction for planning the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When visions are rooted in both the tribal community’s and the individual’s set of values, concerns, and aspirations, they foster commitment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image of circular development layout: Action, Mobilize, Access, Strategic, Capabilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diagram of Five Step process with focus on step 2 Strategic. Picture of two women small business owners.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Tribal Vision is the first step to forming a strategy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this step, one question needs to be answered: What is the shared vision of our economic future? A vision statement publicly declares where a community or business wants to be in the future.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not a wish list of all things that could come true, but a shared understanding of where a community or business agrees to go with an understanding of their own unique setting and commitment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This vision statement helps us focus our attention on choices that assist in achieving our goals. And it works as a guide to making informed decisions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Development: Strategic&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Identifying Advantages&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>• Native American business owners exist in a competitive world and must seek competitive advantages in order to thrive and sustain their way of life.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>• By definition, competitive advantages give a individual or organization an edge over their rivals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>• Knowing the advantages is an important step in establishing opportunities for pursuit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image of circular development layout: Action, Mobilize, Access, Strategic, Capabilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diagram of Five Step process with focus on step 2 Strategic. Tribal advantages are the next area to consider in developing a strategy. We ask: What competitive advantages can be used to pursue economic or business development?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A true competitive advantage is one that is difficult to copy by competitors. By definition, they give an organization an edge over its rivals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Native American tribes and business organizations exist in a competitive world and to succeed, they must know their own competitive advantages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Examples of advantages may include: sovereign rights, special rights, specialized knowledge, unique access to resources, locational advantage, and workforce capabilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Development: Strategic&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Identifying Industry Opportunities&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Economic clusters are geographic concentrations of competing, complementary, or interdependent firms and industries that do business with each other and/or have common needs for talent, technology, and infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Porter, M., Clusters and the New Economics of Competition, Harvard Business Review, Nov. 1, 1998 (*Adapted 2012).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Map of Various United States Industry Clusters. Map of Various United States Industry Clusters. Alaska – Federal Contracting. Silicone Valley – Micro, Venture Capital. Las Vegas – Amusement. Seattle – Aircraft, Boats, Metal Fab. Nationwide – Construction, Natural Resources. Detroit – Auto. New Your City – Financial Services. Nashville – Hospital Management. Houston – Oil and Gas. Hawaii – Tourism.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third stage of forming a strategy is to determine Tribal Industry Opportunities. Here we ask: In what industry will we focus our development effort?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because a tribal community’s pool of resources is necessarily limited, no tribal community can be competitive at everything. They will need to make some hard economic choices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many industries a tribal community can base their economies on including energy, tourism, manufacturing, and banking.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Development: Strategic&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Identifying a Business Development Approach&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can approach development in a strategic manner by choosing how you will organize in order to do business such as:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>• Entrepreneurial incubation&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>• Joint ventures and partnerships&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>• Tribal owned enterprises&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>• Business recruitment&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image of circular development layout: Action, Mobilize, Access, Strategic, Capabilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diagram of Five Step process with focus on step 2 Strategic.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last stage of forming a strategy is finding an Economic Approach.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question we ask: How will we organize to accomplish our economic goals?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Options to organize are:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Entrepreneurialism where communities encourage members to set up their own business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joint ventures where tribes, because of their unique advantages, choose partners to create a business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tribal- owned enterprises&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business recruitment where the tribe scouts for thriving business and brings them to the community.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Development: Capabilities&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding and Developing Capabilities&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image of circular development layout: Action, Mobilize, Access, Strategic, Capabilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diagram showing step three of Business Development Growth process.

We call this phase Capability.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We look at our assets, our organizations and our people to evaluate an overall ability to implement the strategy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, everyone and everything will face the same direction and support each other.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Development: Capabilities Community Resources&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image of circular development layout: Action, Mobilize, Access, Strategic, Capabilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image of seven circles show community capabilities arrows points to: Capital, Workforce/People, Ideas/Innovation, Assets, Infrastructure, Institutions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Capabilities mean things like natural assets, infrastructure, institutions, the skills and knowledge of the people, and social or political capital.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to look at each of these capabilities and evaluate how important they are to the Tribal or organizational strategy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, it makes little sense to build a manufacturing plant if we don’t have a skilled workforce.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, if a community had a capability such as a reputation for a \"hunting culture,\" the community’s goal of creating tourism may work well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Development: Action&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Identify and Manage Actions&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To “make business development happen”, we focus on action, commitment, and communication.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image of circular development layout: Action, Mobilize, Access, Strategic, Capabilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diagram showing step four of the Business Development Growth process noting action.

Action – Initiate Uniform Commercial Code. Start – Finish –October. Responsibility – Paul&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to create an action plan. This plan sets up specific actions, priorities, time schedules and performance measurements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to prioritize these actions and allocate resources such as people or materials to support the implementation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Development: Action&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developing a Commitment Plan&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Commitment -&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>• Decide who needs to be committed to the plan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>• Determine their current level of commitment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>• Develop a plan for improving commitment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image of circular development layout: Action, Mobilize, Access, Strategic, Capabilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Description of table: A table showing various roles in gain commitment. Key Person – Paul, Opposed – X, arrows goes from Don’t know About – Will Let Happen-Will Help and point to Will Make it Happen – Y&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another part of \"making it happen\" is creating a commitment plan. We want to know things such as:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who needs to be committed?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Their commitment levels and the commitment levels required.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A plan to move commitment to desired levels.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And last, a monitoring system to assess progress.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally speaking, we want to know who is important to putting the action plan in place. If these key people do not have the time and energy to carry out the plan then we may want to do something to influence their commitment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to make sure the right people make these commitments. We want to avoid certain pitfalls such as putting people in charge just because they are in formal positions of power.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We can easily see that an action plan serves little value if we do not have committed people putting them into place.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Development: Action&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developing a Communication Plan&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Image of circular development layout: Action, Mobilize, Access, Strategic, Capabilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A table showing various roles in developing communication plan.

We want to tell tribal members, employees and leadership about the action plan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we want to do things like:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ask what is to be communicated.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ask who will receive the information.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Identify key messages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Determine the method of communication.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Identify who is responsible for communication.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And determine the dates.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The more specific the communication plan is, the more successful it will be.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With an action, commitment, and communication plan, we are on our way to \"making it happen.\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business Development: Mobilize&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mobilizing Support&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diagram show Business Development Growth steps focusing on Mobilization.

The course is easy to follow and the subject matter is indexed for quick reference and easy access. It will take about 30 minutes to complete the training program. Additional time will be needed to review included resource materials and to complete the suggested next steps at the end of the course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the way…., the “next steps” outlined at the conclusion of this course are probably the most important part of this training program. The reason ‐‐‐‐ they will help you apply what you have learned and engage you in the government contracting process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you complete the course, you will have the option of receiving a printed Certificate of Completion from the SBA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click the forward button below to get started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 3 Course</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Objectives</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This course has four key objectives:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Provide an overview of the Federal buying market.</li>\r\n\t<li>Explain how and where to find information about government contracting rules.</li>\r\n\t<li>Describe how to find Federal contract opportunities and sell to the government. And,</li>\r\n\t<li>Provide an overview as well as direct access to key contracting resources.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 4 Course</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Outline</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are ten topic sections within this course. Each section covers a different aspect of Federal contracting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reviewed together they tell a story that will help you understand what the federal market is, what the rules are, how to find contract opportunities and, most importantly, how to be successful in selling to the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 5 Course</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Outline</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The course also includes information about specific SBA contracting programs, provides guidance on next steps and provides information and direct access to helpful procurement resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is not the type of training program you want to review once and put aside. It is a comprehensive guide with many opportunities for the viewer to access more detailed information and participate in the Federal procurement process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will notice a button in the top right section of each slide that says Course Outline. Clicking on that button will bring you to the course outline – which will give you quick access to any section of the course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, sit back, get comfortable and let’s get started………</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 6 The Federal Buying</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Market</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. government is the world's largest buyer of products and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Purchases by military and civilian installations amount to nearly $400 billion a year, and include everything from complex space vehicles to janitorial services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In short, the government buys just about every category of commodity and service available. By law, federal agencies are required to establish small business contracting goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current, government‐wide procurement goal is that at least 23% of all government buys should be awarded to small businesses. The key word here, however, is that it’s only a goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 7 The Federal Buying Market</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(Cont)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, Federal contract goals are established for women‐owned businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, firms located in HUBZones and service disabled veteran‐owned businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These government‐wide goals, which are not always achieved, are 5%, 5%, 3% and 3%, respectively. They are important because Federal agencies have a statutory obligation to reach‐out and consider small businesses for procurement opportunities. However, again, these are only goals. It is up to you to market and match your business products and services to the buying needs of specific government agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 8 How the Government</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Buys</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government buys many of the products and services it needs from suppliers who meet certain qualifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition the Government applies standardized buying procedures to acquire what it needs. Throughout this training program we will discuss what qualifications are needed and what procedures are required by the Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 9 How the Government Buys</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(cont)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contrary to how some may portray the government buying process, it is not like going down a dark road.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s like anything else, the more you learn about the process, the easier it becomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 10 How the Government Buys</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(cont)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government applies standardized procedures to purchase the goods and services it needs. Contracting officials use procedures outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, commonly known as the FAR, to guide government buys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary contracting methods used by the government are: &nbsp; Micro‐purchases;&nbsp; &nbsp; Simplified Procedures; Sealed Bidding; Contract Negotiations; and, Consolidated Purchasing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 11 How the Government Buys</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(cont)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally speaking, government purchases of individual items under $3,000.00 are considered micro‐ purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such government buys do not require competitive bids or quotes and agencies can simply pay using a Government Purchase Card or credit card, without the involvement of a procurement officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An important point to remember is that micro‐purchases, unlike other small government buys under</p>\r\n\r\n<p>$100,000, are not reserved for small businesses. It is also important to be able to process credit cards, if you want to accommodate government agencies with their small buys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 12 How the Government Buys</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(cont)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 removed many competition restrictions on government purchases under $100,000. Instead of full and open competition, agencies can use simplified procedures for soliciting and evaluating bids up to $100,000. Government agencies, however, are still required to advertise all planned purchases over $25,000 in Federal Business Opportunities, the government’s online listing and database of available procurement opportunities. Simplified procedures require fewer administrative details, fewer approval levels, and less documentation. The procedures require all federal purchases above $3,000, but under $100,000, to be reserved for small businesses, an important point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This small business set‐aside applies, unless the contracting official can not obtain offers from two or more small firms who are competitive on price, quality and delivery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 13 How the Government Buys</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(cont)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sealed bidding is how the government buys competitively when its requirements are very specific, clear and complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An IFB or “Invitation For Bid” is the method used for the sealed bid process. Typically, an IFB includes a description of the product or service to be acquired, instructions for preparing a bid, the conditions for purchase, delivery, payment and other requirements associated with the bid, including a deadline for bid submissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each sealed bid is opened in a public setting by a government contracting officer, at the time designated in the invitation. All bids are read aloud and recorded. A contract is then awarded by the agency to the lowest bidder who is determined to be fully responsive to the needs of the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government‐wide IFBs are available daily for review in the government’s online listing service, Federal Business Opportunities. This electronic service, which is discussed in detail later, also provides direct links to available IFB invitations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 14 How the Government Buys</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(cont)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contract negotiations are used in many federal procurement actions. This is typically a more complicated process for companies wanting to sell to the government. It is also a method that is more time consuming for buying agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is how it works….. In certain cases, when the value of a government contract exceeds $100,000 and when it necessitates a highly technical product or service, the government may issue a Request for Proposals. In a typical RFP, the government will request a product or service it needs, and solicit proposals from prospective contractors on how they intend to carry out that request, and at what price. Proposals in response to an RFP can be subject to negotiation after they have been submitted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the government is merely checking into the possibility of acquiring a product or service, it may issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ). A response to an RFQ by a prospective contractor is not considered an offer, and consequently, cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract. The order is an offer by the government to the supplier to buy certain supplies or services upon specified terms and conditions. A contract is established when a supplier accepts the offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government‐wide RFPs and RFQs are also available daily for review in the FBO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 15 How the Government Buys</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(cont)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most government agencies have common purchasing needs ‐‐ carpeting, furniture, office machine maintenance, petroleum products and perishable food supplies are just a few examples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes the government can realize economies of scale by centralizing the purchasing of certain types of products or services. This is called consolidated purchasing and multiple award, acquisition vehicles are typically used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most common multiple award schedules are GSA Schedules or Government Wide Acquisition Contracts, called G‐WACs. These centralized buying vehicles are negotiated by the government with awards to many potential vendors and used by multiple agencies buying similar goods and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 16 Federal Contracting</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Rules</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to participate in the Federal procurement arena, you have to know the rules. Understanding the government’s procurement rules is critical to your success as a government contractor. The Federal Acquisition Regulation system is the roadmap for doing business with the government. It outlines all of the rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FAR is issued and maintained jointly by a collaborative board of government agencies and Federal procurement executives. It is a comprehensive guide indexed by topic. Do not be intimidated by its size or apparent complexity. It is an excellent resource tool. The most common FAR sections used by small business are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subpart 8.4 – Federal Supply Schedules Part 13 – Simplified Acquisitions</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 15 – Contracting by Negotiation Part 19 – Small Business Programs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Check out the FAR after you complete this course. You can access it by clicking on the hyperlink. Remember, it’s a tool use it when you need it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 17 Small Business Size</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Standards</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a small business, certain government programs may apply to you. The question then becomes, what is a small business, or more specifically, is my firm a small business?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years SBA has established and revised numerical definitions for all for profit industries, and this numerical definition is called a \"size standard.\" It is almost always stated either as the number of employees or average annual receipts of a business concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to establishing eligibility for SBA programs, all federal agencies must apply SBA's size standards for contracts to be awarded to small firms. Most businesses operating in the United States are considered small businesses. Don’t sweat it or over‐think this issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you complete this course, or another time at your convenience, come back to this section and click on the referenced hyperlinks to determine your small business size eligibility and to learn more about size standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 18 Find Contract</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Opportunities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is impossible to sell your products or services to the government, if you don’t know which agencies are buying, what their needs are and when they need it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To market or outreach contract opportunities to the public, the federal government operates a robust, online service called Federal Business Opportunities, but more commonly known as FBO or FedBizOpps. This single entry, government‐wide Website profiles available business opportunities and is one of the most powerful tools available to help you become successful in government contracting. The online tool identifies contract opportunities over $25,000.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not all contract opportunities, especially those under $25,000.00, are identified in FBO. Prudent prospective contractors should research government buying needs and contact agencies&nbsp; directly. &nbsp; This will take some guidance to focus your search. However, the resources identified at the conclusion of this course can help you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your homework for tonight… Alright homework is the wrong choice of words.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At your convenience, after you complete this course, take a few minutes to visit the FBO Website and familiarize yourself with how it operates, what it displays and why its important. Also, take the time to review the FAQ section of the site. All kidding aside, it will be one of the most important homework assignments you have ever completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hyperlinks to the FBO site are available at multiple locations throughout this course. You can also use the hyperlinks on this slide to directly access FBO and the respective FAQs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 19 Find Contract Opportunities</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(cont)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An alternative to seeking prime contracts is to explore subcontracting&nbsp; &nbsp; opportunities.&nbsp; &nbsp; Subcontracting or teaming with a prime contractor can be a profitable experience as well as a growth opportunity for a business. If, after assessing the capabilities and capacity of your business, you conclude that you are not ready to bid competitively for prime contracts, consider opportunities available through subcontracting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The experience gained from performing as a subcontractor can assist you in responding to solicitations as a prime contractor. Subcontracting, however, should not be viewed only as an opportunity for less‐ experienced businesses, but also as a vehicle to enhance your qualifications to become more competitive to perform as a prime contractor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help small businesses find opportunities, SBA maintains, SUB‐Net, a searchable database of available subcontract opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While this Website is designed primarily as a place for large businesses to post solicitations and notices, it is also used by Federal agencies, state and local Governments, non‐profit organizations, colleges and universities, and even foreign Governments to list available subcontract and partnering opportunities. A hyperlink to SUB‐Net is provided for your convenience and future use<strong>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 20 Define Your Products &amp;</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Services</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need to make it easy for the government to identify the products and services you sell, as well as to uniquely identify your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government agencies use the North American Industry Classification System, more commonly referred to as a NAICS code, to identify products and services by industry type. Learning your NAICS codes is not a difficult thing to do, but it’s important. You can find the NAICS codes for your products and services by clicking on the referenced hyperlink. It is also important to note that you can use your NAICS code or codes to conduct online searches at the Websites of numerous federal agencies to learn what they are buying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To participate in contract opportunities within the Department of Defense (DOD), you will also need to know your Federal Supply Group or Class code. Again, this can be easily obtained by clicking on the FSG hyperlink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A NAICS code, or codes, identifies the products and services your company supplies. It does not uniquely identify your business. The Federal government uses D‐U‐N‐S numbers, provided by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, to identify prospective vendors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can obtain a D‐U‐N‐S number at no cost to you by clicking on the hyperlink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 21 Selling to the</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Government</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok… Let’s recap for a moment. So far we have discussed the federal market, looked at various contracting methods, discussed contracting rules, explained how to find contract opportunities and we talked about identifying your company and products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, let’s explore several other approaches to help position your business so that you can take advantage of government contract opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, we will discuss registering your company with the Central Contractor Registry, marketing your business directly to agencies, and using procurement vehicles. Each of these approaches is further discussed in the following slides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also want to point out the link to the Online Representations &amp; Certifications Application system. This is only provided for future reference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 22 Selling to the Government</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(cont)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Central Contractor Registration, more commonly known as the CCR, is the primary source for agencies to learn about prospective vendors. Let me repeat that…… It is the PRIMARY source for government agencies to learn about prospective vendors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The CCR is a government‐maintained database of companies wanting to do business with the government. This database is a marketing tool for businesses and a searchable list of prospective vendors for the government. The CCR provides agencies with the ability to search for companies based on their abilities, size, location, experience, and ownership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the CCR is the vehicle used to identify or self‐certify your company as a small business, woman‐owned, veteran‐owned and/or a service‐disabled, veteran owned business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have all heard the expression, \"You got to play to win.\" Well, to succeed in government contracting, you have to register to participate. Registering your business in the CCR is a significant, but necessary, step if you want to sell to the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a convenient time, after you complete this training program, click on the hyperlink or icon to learn more about the CCR and, if you are ready, register your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 23 Selling to the Government</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(cont)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from some of the differences we have already talked about, selling to the government is not that much different than selling in the private sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It all comes down to marketing. Learn what agencies or prime contractors have a need for and reach out to them, demonstrating how you can add value and why they should buy from you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, be active. Participate in procurement related conferences, activities and match‐making events. Use these activities to become known and to be a “player.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 24 Selling to the Government</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(cont)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is merit to hitching your wagon to an existing wagon‐train.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OK, so maybe that’s not the best analogy. But, there is merit to participating in a consolidated agreement where multiple vendors are pre‐approved for prospective contract awards from multiple agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earlier in the course we talked about consolidated purchasing programs. Under such programs, the Federal government tries to benefit from economies of scale and make it easier for vendors to sell to the government by establishing Multiple Award Schedules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These schedules are often referred to as procurement vehicles. A prominent example of this type of contracting is the GSA Schedule. As such, GSA negotiates prices and terms with prospective vendors and enters into an agreement. Under the agreement, participating government agencies can purchase products and services from a schedule of prospective vendors, according to prices and terms already agreed to by the vendors. Another procurement vehicle example is Government Wide Procurement Contracts or G‐WACs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Procurement vehicles can be valuable tools. As you continue your journey into the government contracting space, learn as much as you can about procurement vehicles and how they could benefit your business. Use the referenced hyperlinks to learn more about GSA Schedules and available G‐WACs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 25 SBA Certification</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Initiatives</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA administers three certification initiatives, designed to assist specific market groups in the government contracting space. These initiatives include the HUBZone program, the 8(a) Business Development Program and the Small Disadvantaged Business Certification initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each agency initiative is discussed in the following sections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 26 SBA Certification Initiatives</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(cont)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term HUBZone comes from the phrase, Historically Underutilized Business Zone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The HUBZone Program is designed to stimulate economic development and create jobs in urban and rural communities by providing federal contracting preferences to small businesses. These preferences are available to small firms who qualify because they are located in a HUBZone designated area or employ staff who live in such an area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use the hyperlinks to determine if you are in a designated HUBZone area or if you would like to learn more about the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 27 SBA Certification Initiatives</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(cont)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 8(a) Business Development Program is designed to assist eligible socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses. The program provides qualified firms access to capital and credit, business counseling and training, and Federal and non‐Federal procurement opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the award of sole source and limited‐competition contracts, the 8(a) program provides market access and growth for qualified businesses. The 8(a) program is not intended for everyone. You must be eligible to participate and receive formal certification from the SBA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use the hyperlinks, at a later time, to learn more about the 8(a) program and determine if you are eligible and suited for the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 28 SBA Certification Initiatives</strong><strong> </strong><strong>(cont)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA administers two specific business assistance initiatives for small disadvantaged businesses. These initiatives are the 8(a) Program, we just discussed, and Small Disadvantaged Business Certifications. The SDB initiative requires eligible companies to be formally certified by the SBA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the 8(a) Program offers a broad scope of assistance to socially and economically disadvantaged firms, SDB certification strictly pertains to benefits in federal procurement. Firms that are 8(a) certified automatically qualify for SDB certification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use the hyperlink to learn more about SDB certification and specific contract preferences associated with the initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 29 Have a</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Question?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don’t be shy…..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This course has covered a great deal of material. And, there is much to learn and understand about government contracting. If you have questions about the federal market place, government contracting methods, finding contract opportunities or other questions about winning federal contracts, contact SBA or one of our resource partners. We will help you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If we do not have the answer to your specific question, we will direct you to a resource that does. Use the 800 number or referenced hyperlinks to contact us directly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 30 Next</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Steps</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you have completed the course, take the next steps. Put what you have learned into action. This is the most important part of this course. You should consider printing this page so that you have it for future reference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step1. Identify NAICs codes your business operates &nbsp; &nbsp; within. &nbsp; &nbsp; Step2. Apply for a D‐U‐N‐S number, if you do not already have one. Step3. Register in the Central Contractor Registration, the CCR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step4. Familiarize yourself with Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) and practice searching for contract opportunities within your business market areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step5. Learn as much as you can from experienced people in the procurement industry. For starters, discuss what you have learned from this course with an SBA or PTAC representative. Once you have digested that information, call a Federal agency and talk with a government contracting officer. Ask educated questions and learn….. Best of luck…..</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 31 Additional</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Assistance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many resources are available to assist you.

The applicant must be able to demonstrate that it is sufficiently responsible to perform on the contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 3 Question of Responsibility</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question of responsibility…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before any large or small business can be awarded a federal contract, a contracting officer must affirmatively determine that the firm is responsible to perform the specific contract it is otherwise in line to receive. This question of responsibility is the foundation of the COC program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contract responsibility standards are outlined in FAR Subpart 9.1. Slide 4 Course Objectives</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The objectives of this training exercise are to: (1) provide a meaningful overview of the COC program, and (2) assist contracting officers and others to better understand and to more efficiently use the COC program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 5 Course Contents</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The course provides an overview of the COC program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, it outlines the COC referral process, describes small business eligibility requirements, highlights key aspects of the application process and describes SBA’s role in reviewing COC applications and administering the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 6 Program Summary and Governance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Program summary and governance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 7 Program Purpose</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose of the program…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The COC program provides a written certification -- from the SBA to the contracting officer -- that a designated small business has the capability to perform on a specific government contract. It provides a small firm with an avenue of appeal to a contracting officer’s negative determination that it is not sufficiently responsible to fulfill the requirements of a specific federal procurement.&nbsp; The issuance of a COC can only be initiated by a contracting officer’s referral.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Certificate of Competency Program helps a small business establish or reestablish itself as a viable government contractor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 8 COC Program Governance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The COC program is an important small business tool in federal contract markets. It was established by Section 8(b)(7) of the Small Business Act and is primarily governed by 13 CFR</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ol>\r\n\t\t<li>125.5 and FAR Subpart 19.6.</li>\r\n\t</ol>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Slide 9 Referral of Non-Responsibility to SBA Referral of non-responsibility to the SBA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 10 The COC Referral</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The basis of the COC program is the referral…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a contracting officer determines that a potentially successful small business contract- offeror lacks certain elements of responsibility, including but not limited to capability, competency, capacity, credit, integrity, perseverance, tenacity and limitations on subcontracting – the CO is required to refer the matter in writing to the SBA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The referral must include: the solicitation; a copy of the offer submitted by the small business; abstract of bids (if applicable); pre-award survey (if applicable); the CO’s written determination of non-responsibility; technical data package; and, any other justification or determination used to arrive at the non-responsibility determination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, the COC referral must indicate that the offeror has been found to be responsive regarding some elements of the solicitation, but it must also clearly identify the reasons for the determination of non-responsibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 11 Contract Award Withheld – 15 Days or Longer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Upon referral to the SBA -- with all required documentation in-place, the contract award must be withheld by the contracting officer for a period of at least 15 working days – or longer if agreed to by both the SBA and the contracting officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 12 Eligibility Requirements for COC Consideration</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eligibility requirements for COC consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 13 Burden of Proof</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The burden of proof is on the small business offeror…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once a contracting officer’s COC referral is received by the SBA, the agency will then inform the small business of the CO’s determination and offer it the opportunity to apply to the SBA for a Certificate of Competency – by a specific date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The offeror must be able to demonstrate to the SBA that it is eligible for COC consideration. That is, the <strong><em>burden of proof </em></strong>is on the business to show that it meets specific COC eligibility criteria regarding small business size standards, type of business, performance requirements and end products being delivered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 14 Qualify as Small Business</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, the business must qualify as a small business under the size standard applicable to the procurement. If the procurement does not specify a size standard or NAICS code, SBA will assign the appropriate size standard to determine COC eligibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A firm applying for a certificate of competency will be required to submit, among other documents, SBA Form 355, Application for Small Business Size Determination to the SBA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 15 Limitations on Subcontracting Requirements</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Limitations on subcontracting…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If an acquisition is set-aside or reserved, a small business offeror must agree to comply with applicable limitations on subcontracting requirements. This is a general tenet applicable to most small business set-asides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, <strong>agreeing to comply </strong>with limitations on subcontracting requirements is a matter of proposal acceptability and an important requirement for COC eligibility. However, <strong>being</strong><strong> </strong><strong>able to comply </strong>with limitations on subcontracting requirements is a matter of responsibility and is thus an issue that may be addressed with a certificate of competency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is an important distinction between agreeing to comply and being able to comply with limitations on subcontracting requirements.&nbsp; This distinction is unique to the COC program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 16 Non-Manufacturer Small Firms</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A small firm that is a non-manufacturer -- making an offer on a small business set-aside for supplies, must furnish end items manufactured in the United States by a small business. Further, a non-manufacturer small firm, making an offer on an unrestricted procurement or procurement utilizing simplified acquisition procedures, with a cost not exceeding $25,000, must also furnish end items manufactured in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A waiver of the non-manufacturer’s rule may be requested by the contracting officer for either the type of product being purchased or the specific contract at issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 17 Assemblers of Kits</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An offeror intending to provide a kit consisting of finished components or other components provided for a special purpose is also eligible for COC consideration. However, it must meet certain criteria. Specifically:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>it must meet the size standard for the NAICS code assigned to the procurement;</li>\r\n\t<li>each component of the kit is required to be manufactured in the US; and,</li>\r\n\t<li>for a set-aside, each component of the kit is required to be manufactured by a small business that meets the size standard applicable to the component --- unless the contracting officer has received a waiver for this requirement.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 18 COC Application Process</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>COC application process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 19 Notification by the SBA</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As referenced earlier, “the referral” is the basis of the COC program. It is also the start-point for the application process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In federal procurement markets, the contracting officer is required to refer a small business -- who is the apparent successful offeror, but found non-responsible – to the SBA for COC consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SBA’s area office will then inform the business of the contracting officer’s determination and offer the firm the opportunity to apply for a certificate of competency. If the firm agrees to apply, it must do so by submitting all required documentation to the SBA by a specified date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 20 Required Documentation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Required documentation…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the SBA area office notifies an offeror about applying for a certificate of competency, it will identify specific forms and documents to be submitted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every case is different, but in most circumstances the applicant will be requested in writing to submit: SBA Form 1531, “Application for Certificate of Competency;” SBA Form 355, “Application for Small Business Size Determination;” SBA Form 74B, “Monthly Cash Flow;” other specific forms and information identified in the agency’s instructions; and any additional information the small business considers necessary to demonstrate its ability to satisfy the requirements in the solicitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 21 Application Must be Complete and Timely</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The COC application must include all information and documentation requested by the SBA and any additional information which the firm believes will help demonstrate its ability to perform on the contract. Importantly, the requested information must be complete and submitted prior to the date specified by the SBA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If an application for a COC is incomplete or not timely, SBA may close the case without issuing a COC and will notify the contracting officer and the small business offeror with a letter of declination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 22 Review of the Application</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Review of the application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 23 Review Process</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The COC review process is comprehensive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A team of SBA financial and technical specialists will review all COC applications. The review process is not limited to the areas of non-responsibility cited by the contracting officer. Rather, SBA may at its discretion, independently evaluate the COC applicant for all elements of responsibility, but it may presume responsibility exists as to elements other than those cited as deficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, SBA may deny a COC application for reasons of non-responsibility not originally cited by the contracting officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 24 COC Decision by the SBA Director</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After reviewing the COC application submitted by the small firm and other information gathered by the SBA, the agency’s area director will make a determination, either final or recommended as outlined in the highlighted chart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The appropriate SBA director is the agency’s area director closest to the headquarters location for the offering firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 25 Notification of Intent to Issue a COC</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the SBA determines that a COC is warranted, the area director will notify the contracting officer -- or the procurement official with the authority to accept SBA's decision -- of the intent to issue a COC, and of the reasons for that decision, prior to issuing the COC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the time of notification, the contracting officer with the authority to accept SBA's decision has three options: (1) accept the area director’s decision to issue the COC and award the contract to the small business; (2) request the area director to suspend the case to allow for additional review; or, (3) formally appeal the area director’s decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 26 Appeal of a COC Determination</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The appeal of a COC determination…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For COC actions with a value exceeding $100,000, a contracting officer may appeal an area director’s decision to issue a COC to SBA Headquarters by filing an appeal with the area office processing the COC application. The area office must honor the request to the appeal if the contracting officer agrees to withhold the award of the contract until the appeal process is concluded. Without such an agreement, the area director must issue the COC. When such an agreement has been obtained, the area office will immediately forward the case file to SBA Headquarters. <strong>It is important to note, only a contracting officer may appeal the</strong><strong> </strong><strong>area director’s decision to deny a</strong><strong> </strong><strong>COC</strong>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA Headquarters will furnish written notice to the OSDBU director of the procuring agency, with a copy to the contracting officer, that the case file has been received and that an appeal decision may be requested by an authorized official. If the contracting agency decides to file an appeal, it must notify SBA Headquarters through its OSDBU director within 10 working days -- or a time period agreed upon by both agencies -- of its receipt of the notice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The appeal and any supporting documentation must be filed within 10 working days -- or a different time period agreed to by both agencies -- after SBA receives the request for a formal appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 27 Appeal – Requested Through SBA Headquarters</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In those cases where a COC appeal is requested through SBA Headquarters and the contract amount exceeds $25 million, SBA before making a final decision, will take an additional step and contact the contracting agency at the secretariat or equivalent level. It will provide the contracting agency with two additional options: (1) ask SBA to suspend the case so that the agency can meet with SBA Headquarters staff and review all documentation in the COC case file; or (2), submit to SBA Headquarters any new or additional information which the contracting agency believes has not been considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After reviewing all available information, the SBA Director, for the Office of Government Contracting will make a final determination, in writing, to issue or to deny the COC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 28 Reconsideration</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After COC Issuance Reconsideration…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An approved COC may be reconsidered and possibly rescinded, at the sole discretion of the SBA, where an award of the contract has not occurred, and one of the following circumstances exists: (1) the COC applicant submitted false or omitted materially adverse information; (2) new adverse information has been received relating to the current responsibility of the applicant concern; or (3) the COC has been issued for more than 60 days -- in which case SBA may investigate the business concern's current circumstances and the reason why the contract has not been issued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 29 Effect of COC</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Effect of a COC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A certificate of competency is conclusive as it pertains to responsibility. That is, if the SBA issues a COC on behalf of a small business with respect to a particular contract, the contracting officer is required to award the contract without requiring the firm to meet any other requirement with respect to responsibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, if the SBA issues a COC with respect to a referral as discussed earlier in this training program, the contracting officer is not required to issue an award to that offeror if the contracting officer denies the contract for reasons unrelated to responsibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 30 Effect of Denial</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Effect of denial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Denial of a COC by SBA does not preclude a contracting officer from awarding a contract to the referred firm, nor does it prevent the concern from making an offer on any other procurement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 31 Performance of the Contractor</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Performance of the contractor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 32 Monitoring Performance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once a COC has been issued and a contract awarded, the SBA will carefully monitor the performance of the contractor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 33 Resources and Tools</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Resources and tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 34 Resources and Tools</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Numerous resources are available to assist individuals who are interested in learning more about the Certificate of Competency Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 35 Resources and Tools</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use these resources to become better informed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 35 Contact Us…</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about the Certificate of Competency Program..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much information has been discussed and we hope it is helpful.

Visit the resource icon in the course player or locate additional tools, templates, and mentors on SBA.gov once you finish the course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let's get started!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Veteran-Owned Businesses and Opportunities</strong><br />\r\nVeteran-entrepreneurs are an incredibly important dimension in America and in the American economy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SBA is working closely with all Federal agencies to increase contract dollars awarded to Veterans, and here are a few reasons why:<br />\r\n- U.S. military Veterans own 2.4 million businesses, or nearly one in 10 of all businesses nationwide.<br />\r\n- 8.3 percent of Veteran business owners have service-connected disabilities.<br />\r\n- Veteran-owned businesses generate $1.2 trillion in receipts and employ nearly 5.8 million people.<br />\r\n- In the private-sector workforce, Veterans are at least 45 percent more likely than those with no active-duty military experience to be self-employed.<br />\r\n- As highly trained professionals and leaders with experience in challenging environments, Veterans find that entrepreneurship and small business ownership are key opportunities for the more than 250,000 of them that transition out of the military into civilian life each year.<br />\r\n- Historically, about one in seven Veterans chooses self-employment as their vocation. This is a significant percentage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Knowledge Review</strong><br />\r\nThe answer to the following question will be True or False and worth 10 points. Only one attempt will be permitted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the private sector workforce, Veterans are 80 percent more likely than those with no active duty military experience to be self-employed. &nbsp;Is this True or False?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The correct answer is false.<br />\r\nIn the private-sector workforce, Veterans are 45% more likely than those with no active- duty military experience to be self-employed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What You Need to Know Upfront</strong><br />\r\nThere is no book you can read or course you can take that will give you all of the answers about how to be successful in the government contracting space; this course provides a lot of helpful information, but it is only a starting point. Your success will come from continuous learning and hard work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, keep these two simple rules in mind:<br />\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You don't know what you don't know; and<br />\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;There is no substitute for knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find a mentor, talk with successful players in the contracting space, and learn what questions to ask, what mistakes to avoid, and what others have done to be successful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.7&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Federal Buying Market</strong><br />\r\nThe U.S. government is the world's largest buyer of products and services. Purchases by military and civilian installations include everything from complex space vehicles to janitorial services. In short, the government buys just about every category of commodity and service available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.8&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Services for Small Veteran-Owned Businesses</strong><br />\r\nThe SBA is committed to helping America's Veterans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two main services for small Veteran-owned businesses:<br />\r\nOne is the Office of Veterans Business Development, and second is Veterans Business Outreach Centers (VBOCs).<br />\r\nThe agency's Office of Veterans Business Development promotes policies and programs that provide management and other assistance to small businesses owned and controlled by Veterans and service-disabled Veterans. The office also acts as an ombudsman - promoting full consideration of Veterans in all government programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an extension of this Washington-based office, the SBA has established Veterans Business Development officers in each of its 68 district offices across the country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Veterans Business Outreach Centers offer a full menu of business development services that include counseling, training, support applications, and other business assistance tools. These comprehensive services are designed to aid Veteran and service-disabled entrepreneurs, as well as self-employed members of the Reserve and National Guard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.9&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Small Business Incentives</strong><br />\r\nFederal agencies have a statutory obligation to reach out and consider small businesses for procurement opportunities. However, it is up to you to market and match your business products and services to the buying needs of specific government agencies. The goal of 3 percent of government business going to service-disabled Veterans will open some doors - but you must still be able to sell your business on performance, price, and ability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal law requires government agencies to establish small business contracting goals. The goals provide incentives and opportunities for small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal contract goals are established for:<br />\r\n- Service-disabled Veteran-owned businesses - 3%<br />\r\n- Firms located in HUBZones - 3%<br />\r\n- Small disadvantaged businesses - 5%<br />\r\n- Woman-owned businesses - 5%<br />\r\n- Small businesses - 23%</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help Federal agencies achieve the 3 percent government-wide goal for service- disabled Veteran-owned businesses, Congress amended the Small Business Act and established a procurement program for small business concerns which are owned and operated by service-disabled Veterans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.10&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business Program</strong><br />\r\nThis program provides contracting officers the authority to award sole source or set-aside contracts to service-disabled Veteran-business owners, if certain conditions are met.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are two main criteria to meet the conditions: 51 percent and the Contracting Officer's Role. First, a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business concern must be at least 51 percent unconditionally and directly owned and controlled by one or more service-disabled Veterans. Second, the contracting officer for a specific contracting activity determines whether a contract opportunity for such service-disabled Veteran- owned businesses exists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later, we will talk about marketing your business to the government. It is important that your status as a Veteran or service-disabled Veteran be highlighted in your System for Award Management (SAM) profile and other materials used to market to specific agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.11&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Knowledge Review</strong><br />\r\nThe following question is Multiple Choice and is worth 10 points.

Two attempts will be permitted<br />\r\nWhich of the following criteria must be met in order to be eligible and awarded a contract under the Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Program?<br />\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;One of the business owners must have a disability rating of at least 51 percent.<br />\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The business must be at least 51 percent owned by at least one service-disabled veteran.<br />\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The contracting officer for a specific contracting activity determines whether a contract opportunity for such service-disabled Veteran owned businesses exist.<br />\r\nD.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The business owner's status as Service-Disabled Veteran must be registered in the System for Award Management (SAM)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The correct choices are B and C. The program establishes two conditions: The business must be at least 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more service-disabled veterans, and the contracting officer for a specific contracting activity determines whether a contract opportunity for such service-disabled Veteran-owned businesses exists. Select Next to continue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.13&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Unique Small Business Veteran Incentive</strong><br />\r\nThere are some unique small business Veteran incentives. Public Law 109-461, more commonly known as the Veterans First Law, provides unique authority and goals for the Department of Veterans Affairs. The law provides goals and makes it easier for the VA to buy from Veterans and service-disabled Veterans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, certain conditions must be met, and you must register your business online at the vendor information database. &nbsp;Select the link on screen for more information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.14&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How the Government Buys</strong><br />\r\nThe government applies standardized procedures to buy products and services it needs from suppliers who meet certain qualifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary contracting methods used by the government are: Micro-purchases; Simplified Procedures; Sealed Bidding; Contract Negotiations; and Consolidated Purchasing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contracting Officers use procedures outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, commonly known as the FAR, to guide government purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can visit FAR's website for more information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.15&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Micro-purchases</strong><br />\r\nGovernment purchases of individual items under $3,000 are usually considered micro- purchases. Such government buys do not require competitive bids or quotes, and agencies can simply pay using a Government Purchase Card or credit card, without the involvement of a procurement officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An important point to remember is that micro-purchases, unlike other small government buys under $150,000 are not reserved for small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.16&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Simplified Procedures</strong><br />\r\nWhen the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 was introduced, it removed many competitive restrictions on government purchases under $100,000. Instead of full and open competition, agencies can use simplified procedures for soliciting and evaluating bids up to $100,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government agencies, however, are still required to advertise all planned purchases over $25,000 in Federal Business Opportunities (FBO), the government's online listing and database of available procurement opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simplified procedures require fewer administrative details, fewer approval levels, and less documentation. The procedures require all Federal purchases above $3,000, but under $150,000, to be reserved for small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This small business set-aside applies, unless the Contracting Officer cannot obtain offers from two or more small firms who are competitive on price, quality, and delivery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.17&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sealed Bidding</strong><br />\r\nSealed bidding is how the government buys competitively when its requirements are very specific, clear, and complete.<br />\r\nAn IFB or \"Invitation for Bid\" is the method used for the sealed bid process. Typically, an IFB includes a description of the product or service to be acquired, instructions for preparing a bid, the conditions for purchase, delivery, payment and other requirements associated with the bid, including a deadline for bid submissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each sealed bid is opened in a public setting by a Government Contracting Officer, at the time designated in the invitation. All bids are read aloud and recorded. A contract is then awarded by the agency to the lowest bidder who is determined to be fully responsive to the needs of the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government-wide IFBs are available daily for review in the government's online listing service, Federal Business Opportunities. This electronic service, which is discussed in detail later, also provides direct links to available IFB invitations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.18&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Knowledge Review</strong><br />\r\nThe following question is Multiple Choice and is worth 10 points. Two attempts will be permitted</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An Invitation for Bid (IFB) is the method used for a sealed bid process. Which of the following does the IFB not include?<br />\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A description of the product or service to be acquired.<br />\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Instruction for preparing a bid.<br />\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A profile of the bidder.<br />\r\nD.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Other requirements associated with the bid, including a deadline for bid submissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The correct choice is C. Typically, an IFB includes a description of the product or service to be acquired, instructions for preparing a bid, the conditions for purchase, delivery, payment and other requirements associated with the bid, including a deadline for bid submissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.19&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Contract Negotiations</strong><br />\r\nContract negotiations are used in many Federal procurement actions. This is typically a more complicated process for companies wanting to sell to the government. It is also a method that is more time-consuming for the agencies doing the buying. There are typically three contract negotiations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In certain cases, when the value of a government contract exceeds $100,000 and when it necessitates a highly technical product or service, the government may issue a Request for Proposal (RFP). In a typical RFP, the government will request a product or service it needs, and solicit proposals from prospective contractors on how they intend to carry out that request, and at what price. Proposals in response to an RFP can be subject to negotiation after they have been submitted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When responding to an RFP, you want to be sure that you have read the entire document and that you understand what is required in the Statement of Work (SOW). In many cases, there are opportunities to learn more information at a meeting or walk-through.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When responding to the RFP, be sure you are being responsive to the requirements identified. Remember that your response must show that you are responsible and responsive, or your bid will not be considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the government is merely checking into the possibility of acquiring a product or service, it may issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ). A response to an RFQ by a prospective contractor is not considered an offer, and consequently, cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government-wide RFPs and RFQs are also available daily for review in the FBO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.20&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Consolidated Purchasing Programs</strong><br />\r\nMost government agencies have common purchasing needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes the government can realize economies of scale by centralizing the purchasing of certain types of products or services. This is called consolidated purchasing and multiple award; and acquisition vehicles are typically used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most common multiple award schedules are GSA (General Services Administration) Schedules or Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs). These centralized buying vehicles are negotiated by the government with awards to many potential vendors and are used by multiple agencies buying similar goods and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.21&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Rules - An Overview</strong><br />\r\nIf you want to participate in the Federal procurement arena, you have to know the rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding the government's procurement rules is critical to your success as a government contractor. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) outlines all of the rules for doing business with the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a comprehensive guide indexed by topic. Do not be intimidated by its size or apparent complexity. It is an excellent resource tool. The most common FAR sections used by small business are: Federal Supply Schedules, Simplified Acquisitions, Contracting by Negotiation, and Small Business Programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.22&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Rules - Size Does Matter</strong><br />\r\nAs a small business, certain government programs may apply to you. The question then becomes, what is a small business? Or, more specifically, is your firm a small business?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years the SBA has established and revised numerical definitions for all for- profit industries, and this numerical definition is called a \"size standard.\" It is almost always stated either as the number of employees or average annual receipts of a business concern.<br />\r\nIn addition to establishing eligibility for SBA programs, all Federal agencies must apply the SBA's size standards for contracts to be awarded to small firms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.23&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Contracting Opportunities for Veteran Entrepreneurs</strong><br />\r\nYou need to make it easy for the government to identify your business as well as to identify the products and services you sell. In order to sell to the government you need to do the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One, define your business and products using a DUNS and NAICS code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government agencies use the North American Industry Classification System, more commonly referred to as a NAICS code, to identify products and services by industry type. You can find the NAICS codes for your products and services by clicking on the referenced hyperlink. It is also important to note that you can use your NAICS code or codes to conduct online searches at the websites of numerous Federal agencies to learn what they are buying. A NAICS code identifies the products and services your company supplies. It does not uniquely identify your business. The Federal Government uses D-U- N-S numbers, provided by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, to identify prospective vendors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two, register your firm in the System for Award Management (SAM). The System for Award Management (SAM) is the Official U.S. government system that consolidated the capabilities of CCR/FedReg, ORCA, and EPLS. There is NO fee to register for this site. We have all heard the expression, \"You've got to play to win.\" Well, to succeed in</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government contracting, you have to register to participate. Registering your business in the CCR is a significant and primary step to sell to the Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three, market directly to agencies. Aside from some of the differences we have already talked about, selling to the government is not that much different than selling in the private sector. It all comes down to marketing. Learn what agencies or prime contractors have a need for and clearly demonstrate how you can add value and why they should buy from you. In addition, be active. Participate in procurement-related conferences, activities, and matchmaking events. Use these activities to become known and to be a \"player.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Four, use established procurement vehicles. Earlier in the course, we talked about consolidated purchasing programs. Under such programs, the Federal government tries to benefit from economies of scale and make it easier for vendors to sell to the government by establishing Multiple Award Schedules (MAS). These schedules are often referred to as procurement vehicles. A prominent example of this type of contracting is the General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule. GSA negotiates prices and terms with prospective vendors and enters into an agreement. Under the agreement, participating government agencies can purchase products and services from a schedule of prospective vendors, according to prices and terms already agreed to by the vendors. Another procurement vehicle example is Government-Wide Procurement Contracts or GWACs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Procurement vehicles can be valuable tools. As you continue your journey into the Government contracting space, learn as much as you can about procurement vehicles and how they could benefit your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.24&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Knowledge Review</strong><br />\r\nThe answer to the following question will be True or False and worth 10 points. Only one attempt will be permitted</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A response to a Request for Quotation is considered an offer and may be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The correct answer is False. The government issues an RFQ when it is merely checking into the possibility of a product or service. Therefore, responding to an RFQ is not considered an offer and cannot be accepted to form a binding contract.

This single-entry, government-wide website profiles available business opportunities and is one of the most powerful tools available to help you become successful in Government contracting. The online tool identifies contract opportunities over $25,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At your convenience, take a few minutes to visit the FBO website and familiarize yourself with how it operates, what it displays, and why it's important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hyperlinks to the FBO site are available at multiple locations throughout this course. You can also use the hyperlinks on this site to access the FBO directly, as well as accessing important training information about how to use the FBO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.26&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) - Finding Opportunities</strong><br />\r\nThe FBO is an excellent tool to find contract opportunities. It has been refined to make it easier for potential contractors to find recovery-based contract opportunities. The FBO created a new dimension within the site specifically to find and review recovery-based contract opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FedBizOpps.gov website has a link to search for recovery opportunities, including more information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An alternative to seeking prime contracts is to explore subcontracting opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subcontracting with a prime contractor can be a profitable experience as well as a growth opportunity for a business. If, after assessing the capabilities and capacity of your business, you conclude that you are not ready to bid competitively for prime contracts, consider opportunities available through subcontracting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help small businesses find opportunities, the SBA maintains SUB-Net, a searchable database of available subcontracting opportunities.<br />\r\nAlthough the SBA makes the database available as a small business resource, it is up to prime contractors to update SUB-Net with contract opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A hyperlink to SUB-Net is provided for your convenience and future use. Significant recovery-based funds are available in the form of government grants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Federal grant is an award of financial assistance from a Federal agency to a recipient to carry out a public purpose of support or stimulation authorized by the U.S. government. Federal grants are not Federal assistance or loans to individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twenty-six Federal agencies offer over 1,000 grant programs annually in various categories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about Federal grants, visit their website. You can also find specific grant opportunities as a result of the Recovery Act at the website on screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.27&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Federal Business Opportunities (FBO) - Prepare for the Future</strong><br />\r\nThings never stay the same. &nbsp;Successful companies plan for the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Five years from now the Department of the Navy will still be buying ships and the Veterans Administration (VA) will still be buying laundry, food, and other services for Veterans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government will continue to buy new and innovative products and services to protect and improve the lives of American citizens. &nbsp;Areas of future growth will likely include: renewable energy; clean and smart grid technology; life sciences; nanotechnology; broadband services; high-definition education programs; and many others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider future needs as you evolve your company vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.28&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Knowledge Review</strong><br />\r\nThe following question is Multiple Choice and is worth 10 points.

Individual companies within the cluster feed on each other and succeed or fail, not just because of their own efforts, but in part because of the overall success of the cluster in the region. &nbsp;This multiplier effect is due to inter-regional networks, robust collaboration, regional government and academic support, and expanded marketing. All of these factors working together draw national attention and customers to a hub of clustered knowledge, innovation, and production.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SBA is a strong supporter of industry cluster initiatives - a formally organized effort to promote cluster growth and competitiveness through collaborative activities among cluster participants. In 2010, the SBA created a pilot Regional Innovation Cluster Initiative. In 2011, the SBA collaborated with the Departments of Labor and Commerce to launch the Jobs and Innovation Accelerator Challenge (JIAC), the first interagency cluster initiative. In 2012, the SBA and the Departments of Commerce, Labor, and Energy announced the third JIAC and awarded funds to existing clusters focusing on Advanced Manufacturing. &nbsp;In total, the SBA is investing in or supporting over 56 clusters throughout the United States that span a variety of industries, ranging from energy and manufacturing to agriculture and advanced defense technologies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through intensive, industry-specific technical assistance, the SBA Cluster Initiatives help small business innovators commercialize promising technologies needed by government and industry buyers in that particular sector. Services such as showcasing, networking, and \"demonstration events\" help get small businesses and their products in front of investment and other funding sources, research institutions, and customers/buyers in order to bring products to market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A more in-depth synopsis of the SBA Cluster Initiatives, research reports, and a map of federally funded Cluster Initiatives can be found at their website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.30&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SBA Certification Programs</strong><br />\r\nThe SBA administers two certification programs designed to assist specific market groups in the government contracting space. These programs include the HUBZone program and the 8(a) Business Development Program.<br />\r\nLearn more about each of these programs by selecting the hyperlinks on screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.31&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tipping Point</strong><br />\r\nThere is a reason why some people are more successful than others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The same can be said about small businesses in the government contracting arena. Some firms are clearly more successful. However, the listed tips may put the odds in your favor:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Business Plan - Prepare a clear business vision and strategy.<br />\r\nSAM - Develop a crisp and informative profile describing your business products and services.<br />\r\nFBO - Become an expert in understanding how to use and find contract opportunities.

Welcome to SBA’s training module, Counterfeit Parts – Prevention and Guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 2 Introduction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is a growing abundance of counterfeit electronic and other parts showing up in federal contracting. This problem is challenging for the federal government, and has been especially troublesome in areas of defense acquisition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This short presentation reviews the counterfeit parts problem and outlines preventive measures that are currently in place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 3 Counterfeit Parts – The Problem</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The use of counterfeit parts in federal procurement is a significant problem. In 2011, the Senate Armed Services Committee identified some 1,800 cases of counterfeiting, involving roughly 1 million government purchased, or about to be purchased parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The risks associated with this problem are challenging and huge. Such risks are reflected in early product failure, high repair costs, mission failure and even national security catastrophes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 4 DOD Anti-Counterfeit Actions Countering the counterfeit problem…</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an effort to mitigate the acquisition of counterfeit electronic parts, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012, included provisions – outlined in Section 818 – that, among other things, require greater responsibilities on the part of contracting entities and contractors to prevent counterfeit parts from entering federal supply chains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In May of 2014, the Defense Department issued a final rule, known as the anti-counterfeit rule and published it in the DOD Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement.&nbsp; The rule took effect immediately on May 6th and established a series of anti-counterfeit requirements for both prime contractors and subcontractors.&nbsp; This DFARS rule is significant and important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 5 New DOD Requirements</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new DFARS rule requires contractors to establish a counterfeit electronic part detection and avoidance system or modify an existing system to come into compliance with the new rule. The rule does not apply to small business prime contractors – those who are not subject to Cost Accounting Standards, but small firms serving as subcontractors may be impacted through flow-down provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contractors subject to the rule – that is, contractors subject to the Cost Accounting Standards under section 26, of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act (41 U.S.C. 422) and that supply electronic parts or products that include electronic parts – must establish and maintain a counterfeit electronic part detection and avoidance system in compliance with the new rule. The rule – as just noted - also contains flow-down provisions requiring that all subcontractors establish and maintain counterfeit electronic part detection and avoidance systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 6 Counterfeit&nbsp; Detection and Avoidance System</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contractors subject to the rule are required to establish a counterfeit electronic part detection and avoidance system or modify an existing system to come into compliance with the new rule. The anti- counterfeit systems must address, at a minimum, twelve key areas in order to qualify as meeting acceptable standards outlined in the rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The twelve systems areas that contractors must address include: training of personnel; processes to abolish counterfeit parts; processes to trace parts; using suppliers that are the original manufacturers; reporting counterfeit parts; and, establishing procedures to identify suspect counterfeit parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 7 Counterfeit Detection and Avoidance System (cont)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, the contractor system must address: designing, operating and maintaining systems to detect and avoid counterfeit parts; the flow-down of counterfeit detection and avoidance requirements to subcontractors; processes for keeping informed of current counterfeiting trends; processes for screening the Government-Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP) reports; establishing a plan to control obsolete electronic parts; and inspection and testing of electronic parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, the new rule holds contractors liable for the costs of any counterfeit or suspect counterfeit parts, as well as any re-work or corrective action costs required to remedy the use of such parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 8 Reporting Counterfeit Parts</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the key provisions in this rule relates to reporting counterfeit or suspected counterfeit parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The rule requires contractors to report to the contracting officer and to the Government-Industry Data Exchange Program – GIDEP, counterfeit or suspected counterfeit parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 9 Beyond DOD</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government’s anti-counterfeit actions will soon go beyond the Department of Defense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, in June of 2014, issued a proposed rule that would require all contractors, not just DOD contractors to report suspected counterfeit or defective parts to the Government-Industry Data Exchange Program - GIDEP. In addition, contractors would have to review the GIDEP database before purchasing parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The proposed rule tracks the tenets of the DFARS rule just discussed, but it’s uniquely different. The proposed rule applies to all federal contracts, not just DOD related procurements, and it applies to all parts and products being acquired by the government, not just electronic parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bottom line, this proposed rule, like the DFARS rule, is intended to reduce the risk of counterfeit items entering the government’s supply chain by ensuring that contractors and subcontractors report suspect items to a widely available database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 10 Resources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Section and topic divide --- no narrative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 11 Resources and Tools</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Numerous resources are available to assist individuals who are interested in learning more about government contracting and specifically, issues concerning counterfeit parts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 12 Resources and Tools</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use these resources to become better informed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 13 Contact Us…</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about the problems and prevention of counterfeit parts in federal</p>\r\n\r\n<p>procurement.

Perhaps you are wondering how<br />\r\nyou will manage once you retire. You are definitely not alone. A growing number of women over</p>\r\n\r\n<p>the age of 50 are turning to small business ownership. We call them \"encore entrepreneurs\".</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are 10.1 million firms owned by women (50% or more of all small businesses), employing<br />\r\nmore than 13 million people, and generating $1.9 trillion in sales as of 2008, (Statistics from the</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Center for Women's Business Research, 2006).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you are interested in starting a small business right away, or intend to wait until<br />\r\nretirement, now is the time to explore the possibilities. There are as many reasons for starting a<br />\r\nsmall business as there are Americans reaching retirement age. Corporate layoffs, the need for<br />\r\nsupplemental income, and a desire for a more flexible lifestyle can all play a part.<br />\r\nAdvanced<br />\r\ntechnology is leveling the playing field for small businesses and many individuals approaching<br />\r\nretirement are now able to realize their personal ambition to be their own boss and reap the<br />\r\nrewards. According to government figures 15 percent of workers ages 50 to 64 are self-<br />\r\nemployed. That number rises to 25 percent for workers 65 or older.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSlide 5</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rise in Senior Female Entrepreneurship (cont.)<br />\r\noSole proprietorships and home-based or online<br />\r\nbusinesses are a natural fitoA popular option is buying and selling merchandise through online auctionsoYou can get help from the SBA and its resource<br />\r\npartners<br />\r\nOwning your own small business can be an exciting change of pace, as well as a terrific way to<br />\r\nstay engaged and productive. As a workforce veteran, you bring a great deal to the table.<br />\r\nMaturity, strong finances, and a wide network of professional contacts and associates are skills<br />\r\nand assets you have developed before your retirement. For many senior entrepreneurs, starting<br />\r\na small business can be an opportunity to transform a lifetime hobby or experience and skills<br />\r\ngained from a previous career into a rewarding business venture.<br />\r\nSole proprietorships, home-based and online businesses are often a natural fit for older small<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nbusiness owners. They are less expensive to start and allow for more flexibility. A popular<br />\r\noption is buying and selling merchandise through online auctions and e-tailers. Regardless of the type of small business you are interested in, there are some basic concepts<br />\r\nyou need to understand to help you in the planning process. Whether you are interested in<br />\r\nstarting a side business right away or intend to wait until retirement, now is the time to explore<br />\r\nthe possibilities.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSlide 6</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Benefits of being in Business for yourselfoOwning your own business affords you the opportunity to express yourself and have<br />\r\nmore control of your future.<br />\r\noDirect control over work/life balanceoEven though there is inherent risk, you have greater control of your financial success.<br />\r\nOwning your own business affords you the opportunity to express yourself and have more<br />\r\ncontrol of your future. Though there is inherent risk, you have greater control of your financial<br />\r\nsuccess. The flexibility of owning your own business allows you to effectively balance your work<br />\r\nand personal time; giving you the income you desire and the time to spend with family as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlocking your potential and aligning your interest with your business venture</p>\r\n\r\n<p>o<br />\r\nYou need to take into consideration what you need from a business lifestyle that will<br />\r\nfulfill you in all aspects of your lifestyle. One way to consider the greatest potential in an<br />\r\nindustry is to assess its growth over the past five years. You may ask herself what types of<br />\r\nbusinesses noted women entrepreneurs are running; are they dot-com businesses, service<br />\r\nbusinesses or product manufacturing? You may also want to assess the faltering industries<br />\r\nwithin the past five years. Look at the failures carefully; be sure to grab key points from each<br />\r\nbusiness to take into consideration before you decide on your own business. Learning from the<br />\r\nmistakes of others is important in not making the same mistake yourself.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSlide 7</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Three things that are important to achieving success in business are:<br />\r\noA true entrepreneurial attitude:This mean you<br />\r\nhave to be dedicated and refuse to quit when things get tough.<br />\r\noNetworking: You can use online networks as well as social opportunities to build connections with potential clients and partners.<br />\r\noAdaptability:The ability to accept constructive criticism will help your business stay on the cutting edge and avoid potential problems you might not be able to see on your own.<br />\r\nThree things that are important to achieving success in business are:<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A true entrepreneurial attitude: This mean you have to be dedicated and refuse to quit<br />\r\nwhen things get tough.<br />\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Networking: Few things will help you establish and grow your business faster than a<br />\r\ncreating a strong network.

Even the best prepared business owners can fall<br />\r\nvictim to external forces such as a bad economy. The real issue is; where do we find the<br />\r\nresources to rise above a bad situation and start all over again?<br />\r\nYou can mourn your losses and then celebrate the gifts that come out of the loss. Take a good,<br />\r\nclose look at the business you are reviving. Make a list of the things that have been beneficial to<br />\r\nyou from being in the business. Perhaps there are some things that you have learned and skills<br />\r\nyou have honed such as marketing, sales, inventory, customer service, accounting, hiring, etc. -the<br />\r\nlist is endless. These are gifts or assets, and they are yours to keep for as long as you live.<br />\r\nAnd once you get the business back on track, branch out by doing workshops and writing<br />\r\nbooklets, and maybe even start a blog helping others to reboot their lives after a setback.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSlide 9</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some Things to Consider as you begin your second career as an Entrepreneur.<br />\r\noBe clear about what you wantoChoosing your Business Idea-What are you interested in?<br />\r\n-What skills do you have to offer?<br />\r\n-How do you want your life to look?<br />\r\n-Can you see an unfulfilled market?<br />\r\nSome Things to Consider as you begin your second career as an Entrepreneur.<br />\r\nBelow are some tips to help you formulate your business idea and put it into action, while<br />\r\ntaking into consideration your retirement planning and needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Be Clear About What You Want<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nStarting a business can be more than a full-time job, especially in its infancy. So it's important to<br />\r\nassess what you want from your business and how much time can you dedicate to your venture.<br />\r\nMany business types give you the option to be flexible - home-based businesses, online<br />\r\nbusinesses, consulting, freelancing, and so on. With this kind of flexibility you can adjust and<br />\r\nscale your commitment as needed.<br />\r\nIf you need some help assessing your readiness to start a business, use this \"Start-Up<br />\r\nAssessment Tool\" from the SBA at http://web.sba.gov/sbtn/sbat/index.cfm?Tool=4<br />\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Choosing your Business Idea<br />\r\nThere are some very important things to keep in mind as you decide on your business.<br />\r\nThink<br />\r\nabout the things that you are good at.

Freelancing, particularly if you are unincorporated, is one of the least paperwork-intensive<br />\r\nforms of business ownership. As a freelancer you will still need to be sure you have the right<br />\r\nlicenses or permits, make estimated tax payments on time, report your earnings each year, and<br />\r\ndeal with client paperwork such as contracts, non-disclosure agreements, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next we will talk about some things you need to help you stay on top of your obligations, here's<br />\r\na breakdown of key legal and regulatory processes, plus important \"business-ready\" documentation you'll need when dealing with new clients<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSlide 18</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Legal and Regulatory RequirementsoGet the right licenses and permitsoRegister your business nameoPay estimated taxesoComplete a W-9 form when you get a new cliento1099 Form<br />\r\nHere's what you'll need to do to ensure you set up and manage your freelance business legally:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Get the Right Licenses and Permits -All businesses need some form of license or permit to operate in their state, county or city. In all likelihood, your freelance business is<br />\r\noperated out of your home. You may need a Home Occupancy Permit and a General Business License. You can get both from your local government website or simply use SBA's \"Permit Me\"<br />\r\nonline tool for information about the licenses or permits you may<br />\r\nneed based on your zip code and business type. Be sure to obtain these before you start doing any business. You can get that information online here: http://www.sba.gov/licenses-and-permits</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Register Your Business Name -<br />\r\nIf you want to name your business anything other<br />\r\nthan your given name you will need to register a \"Doing Business As\" name with your<br />\r\nlocal government. If you use your own name you may skip this step<br />\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Pay Estimated Taxes -<br />\r\nThis one often comes as a surprise to new freelancers who<br />\r\nare used to having their taxes withheld by an employer. As a freelancer, it's your<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nresponsibility to pay Uncle Sam and your state revenue agency as you earn income each quarter. If you expect to owe $1,000 or more when you file your annual return you<br />\r\nmust pay estimated taxes on income.<br />\r\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Complete a W-9 Form When You Get a New Client -<br />\r\nWhen you ink an agreement<br />\r\nor start work with a new client, it's likely they will ask you to complete IRS Form W-9<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n(you may have to ask them for it). Filling out a W-9 is straightforward. Provide your<br />\r\nname and social security number, or \"Doing Business As\" name. The client holds this<br />\r\nform and doesn't send it to the IRS; it's a formal certification by you that your tax ID<br />\r\n(SSN) is correct. The form also asks if you are subject to backup withholding - most<br />\r\ntaxpayers are exempt.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Annual Tax Reporting: The 1099 Form -<br />\r\nIf you've earned more than $600 in a year<br />\r\nfrom a client, they have to report these payments to the IRS through Form 1099-Misc. Your client will send you a copy by the end of January each year. Be sure that it is<br />\r\naccurate and the amount the client states matches your records. There is no need to do<br />\r\nanything with the form other than placing it in your records for reference when reporting<br />\r\nyour annual income to the IRS. Think of it as the freelancer's equivalent of the W-2</p>\r\n\r\n<p>form.<br />\r\nEven though it is implied may need to keep this sentence for clarity.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSlide 19</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Businesses you can start with little capitaloConsulting for your former employeroWeb businessesoVirtual assistantoSkin careoOnline social media consultingoConvenience services for consumers<br />\r\nConsulting for your former employer or in your old industry -Even though your former</p>\r\n\r\n<p>employer reduced staffing the work load may have stayed the same. It is not uncommon for an<br />\r\nemployer to bring back former employees as consultants. If the possibility of consulting does<br />\r\nnot exist with your past employer, consider other companies in the same industry.<br />\r\nTake the time<br />\r\nto network and utilize the contacts you developed over the years. You should also consider<br />\r\nonline networking services and freelance market places like Elance.com.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Web businesses -There are several web businesses that can be run from the comfort of your<br />\r\nhome.

You can run home parties to demonstrate and sell your wares. Some of the entrepreneurs have<br />\r\ne-commerce sites they use to sell their skin care products as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Online social media consulting; online content production -To say that social media has<br />\r\nexploded in the past year is an understatement. Social media, and the content that goes along<br />\r\nwith it, is time-consuming for many businesses. This is a great opportunity for to provide your<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nservices as a content provider.

Taken together, the three parts represent a comprehensive -- government contracting -- guide for small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 3 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Learning Objectives</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After reviewing this training program you should:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Have a general understanding and know about federal contract markets and contract opportunities.</li>\r\n\t<li>Understand prime contracting and subcontracting assistance programs and how they can be used to take advantage of federal contract opportunities.</li>\r\n\t<li>Understand SBA’s certification programs – the 8(a) Business Development and HUBZone programs.</li>\r\n\t<li>And, know about the newly implemented women owned small business program and the veteran owned small business programs.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 4 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Scope of the Federal Buying Market</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The U.S. government is the world's largest buyer of products and services. Purchases by military and civilian installations amount to nearly $350 billion a year, and include everything from complex space vehicles to janitorial services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In short, the government buys just about every category of commodity and service available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>\fSlide 5 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Small Firms are the Engine of Growth</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Small businesses have always been the engine for economic growth. They provide jobs, innovation and bring competition to the marketplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Government’s procurement policy – which encourages “maximum practicable” prime and subcontracting opportunities for small businesses – is a catalyst for economic growth. With a government contracting market representing more than a half trillion dollars, it makes solid economic sense to help small firms get their fair share of federal contract dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 6 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What is a Small Business?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Certain government programs apply only to small businesses. The question then becomes, what is a small business, or more specifically, how do you determine if you are a small business?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over the years SBA has established and revised numerical definitions for all for-profit industries, and this numerical definition is called a \"size standard.\" It is almost always stated either as the number of employees or average annual receipts of a business concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition to establishing eligibility for SBA programs, all federal agencies must apply SBA's size standards for contracts to be awarded to small firms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The referenced hyperlinks can be used to determine small business size eligibility and to learn more about size standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 7 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Prime Contract Assistance</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Prime contract assistance-no narrative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 8 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Prime Contract Assistance</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Helping small businesses benefit from federal prime contracts is an obligation of all federal agencies and a key responsibility of SBA and its staff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Multiple programs and initiatives are available to support this effort. They include government-wide contracting goals, small business set-asides, small business size standards and SBA’s Certificate of Competency program. Each of these programs is discussed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 9 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Government-Wide Contracting Goals</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Federal statute defines government-wide prime contracting goals. Such goals represent a primary tool in helping small firms be considered for government contracts. SBA plays a pivotal role in administering the government-wide goals initiative and works with individual agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The current, government-wide procurement goal is that at least 23% of all federal government contracting dollars should be awarded to small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fIn addition, targeted sub-goals are established for women-owned small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, firms located in HUBZones and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses. These targeted goals are 5%, 5%, 3% and 3%, respectively, and are meant to be subsets of the overall small business goal of 23 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These goals are important because federal agencies have an obligation to reach-out and consider different types of small businesses for procurement opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 10 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Small Business Set-asides</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Small business set-asides are a powerful tool for helping small firms win federal prime contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fundamentally, government buys that have an anticipated dollar value exceeding $3,000, but not over $150,000 are automatically reserved or set-aside for small businesses. This is required unless the contracting officer determines there is not a reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from two or more responsible small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 11 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Small Business Set-asides</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Small business set-asides are influenced by the Rule of Two, the Non-manufacture Rule and Subcontracting Limitations. Further, contracts can be set-aside for small businesses certified in the 8(a) Business Development Program or the HUBZone Program. Or, they can be set-aside for qualified women owned small businesses or service disabled veteran owned small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 12 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rule of Two</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For acquisitions over $150K – they too are to be set-aside for small business, when there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two responsible small business concerns, and the award can be made at a fair market price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is important to note, consideration is first for a set-aside or sole source award under the 8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business or Woman Owned Small Business programs before a general small business set-aside. However there is no order of precedence among 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB or WOSB programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 13 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Non-Manufacturer Rule</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The non-manufacturer rule is an important provision impacting small business set-asides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For small business set-asides, other than for construction or service contracts, the prime contractor must utilize a small business manufacturer – if the firm itself, is not doing the manufacturing to complete the work. In industries where the SBA determines there are no or very limited small business manufacturers, it may issue individual or class waivers to the non-manufacture rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is important to note, for small business set-asides for supplies, the prime contractor must either qualify as a manufacturer or supply the product of a domestic small business manufacturer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fFor acquisitions that are under $25,000, the rule does not apply. Use the FAR references to learn more about the specifics surrounding the Non-manufacture Rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 14 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Limitations on Subcontracting</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Limitations on subcontracting apply to solicitations and contracts for supplies, services and construction, if any portion of the requirement is set-aside for small business and the contract amount exceeds $150,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This limitation applies to service contracts, such that at least 50% of the contract cost for personnel must be expended for employees of the small business. For supply contracts, the business must perform work for at least 50% of the cost of manufacturing the supplies, not including the cost of materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And finally for general construction contracts, the business must perform at least 15% of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of the materials, with its own employees. For construction by special trade contractors, the business must perform at least 25% of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of the materials, with its own employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 15 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">8(a) Business Development Program</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Contracting officers can set-aside purchases for small firms certified in the 8(a) Business Development Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">8(a) set-asides are a powerful tool for agencies to achieve small business and small disadvantaged business contracting goals. An 8(a) set-aside can be facilitated as a sole source or competitive acquisition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">More details about the 8(a) program are provided in a later section of this training program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 16 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">HUBZone Program</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Contracting officers can also set-aside purchases for small businesses located in designated HUBZones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To participate in this type of set-aside, a small firm’s principal office must be located in a HUBZone and at least 35% of the firm’s employees must reside within a HUBZone, or certify that at least 35% of its employees engaged in a HUBZone contract will reside in a HUBZone or Indian reservation</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The HUBZone program is discussed in greater detail later in this training program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 17 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Women Owned Small Business Program</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Changes to the Small Business Act now authorize contract set-asides for women owned small businesses and/or economically disadvantaged women owned small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This change creates opportunities for women entrepreneurs and will help agencies to meet government-wide contracting goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fSpecifics of the WOSB program are discussed later in this training module.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 18 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Program</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A contracting officer can also set-aside acquisitions for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To participate in this type of set-aside, such businesses must be at least 51% owned and controlled by a service disabled veteran and the daily management operations of the concern must be controlled by a service-disabled veteran or caregiver. And, they must be a small business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 19 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Small Business Size Standards</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">SBA has established and continually updates numerical definitions for all industries or NAICS codes. This numerical definition is called a small business size standard. It is almost always stated either as the number of employees or the average annual sales of the business concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All federal agencies must apply SBA’s size standards for contracts to be awarded to small firms. It is also important to note, only SBA can reconcile size protests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Use the hyperlink to determine the applicable size standard for a specific NAICS code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 20 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Certificate of Competency Program</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The COC program is helpful to many small firms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If an apparent successful offeror is determined to be “non-responsible” by the contracting officer, the contracting officer is required to refer the matter to the SBA for a Certificate of Competency or COC review. Based on the review, the SBA may issue a certificate of competency declaring the “referred company” – as sufficiently responsible for the purposes of receiving and performing the specific contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 21 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Subcontracting Assistance</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Subcontracting assistance-no narrative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Slide 22 Find Subcontracting Opportunities</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An alternative to seeking prime contracts is to explore subcontracting opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Subcontracting with a prime contractor can be a profitable experience as well as a growth opportunity for a small business. If your small business is not ready or lacks the capabilities to bid competitively for prime contracts, it should consider opportunities available through subcontracting. SBA maintains a database of subcontracting opportunities. This searchable database is called SUB-Net.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 23 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Subcontracting Assistance Programs</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fPrime contractors receiving contracts greater than the simplified acquisition threshold must agree in the contract that small businesses, specifically veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran owned small businesses, women-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and small disadvantaged businesses – will have the maximum practical opportunity to participate as subcontractors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As such, prime contractors are required to establish subcontracting plans describing who and how small businesses will participate as subcontractors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 24 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Subcontracting Plans</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Subcontracting plans are required for contracts over $1.5 million for construction and $6.5 million for all others. There are three types of subcontracting plans: individual, master and commercial subcontracting plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These written plans – which become part of the contracting file – are designed to describe specific efforts by a prime contractor to ensure that small businesses have an equitable opportunity to compete and participate as “subs” in specific contracts. The subcontracting plans may include specific goals and will define requirements for reports and documentation to be maintained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 25 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Subcontracting Goals</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Government-wide numerical subcontracting goals are established by statute for small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran owned small businesses and HUBZone certified small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">All other subcontracting goals are negotiated between the respective government agency and the prime contractor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 26 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">SBA Certifications</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">SBA certifications-no narrative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 27 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">SBA Certifications</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">SBA administers two certification programs designed to assist specific market groups in the government contracting space. These programs are the 8(a) Business Development Program and the HUBZone Program. Each of these programs represents an excellent vehicle for assisting small firms to win federal contracts. These programs also play a primary role in helping agencies achieve, respective SDB and HUBZone contracting goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Informal certification programs – for women and veterans – are also discussed later in this program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 28 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">8(a) Business Development Program</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The 8(a) Business Development Program is designed to assist eligible socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses. The program – which is primarily a business development program - \fprovides qualified firms access to capital and credit, business counseling and training, and contracting opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through the award of sole source and set-aside contracts, the 8(a) program provides market access and growth for qualified businesses. The program is an efficient contracting vehicle for achieving small business and SDB goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is important to note – all 8(a) certified firms are also SDBs, but all small disadvantaged businesses are not necessarily 8(a) certified. Qualified firms can participate in the 8(a) program for up to nine years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 29 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">8(a) Business Development Program</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are unique benefits to participants in the 8(a) program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Certified firms can receive sole-source contracts, up to $4 million for goods and services requirements and up to $6.5 million for manufacturing requirements. Firms are also allowed to form joint ventures and teams to bid on contracts, giving them greater flexibility to compete for larger prime contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">8(a) certified firms can also participate in the Mentor-Protégé Program, giving them the opportunity to learn the ropes from other experienced 8(a) businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 30 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">8(a) Business Development Program</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To be eligible for participation in the 8(a) Business Development Program, the applicant must be a small business and be at least 51% owned and controlled by a socially and economically disadvantage individual or individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Certain individuals are presumed to be socially disadvantaged – they are African-Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, Native Americans and Subcontinent Asian Americans. An individual who is not a member of one of the groups listed can be admitted to the program if he or she shows – through a preponderance of the evidence – that he or she is socially disadvantaged. The evidence can be based on color, ethnic origin, gender, physical handicap or geographic environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, successful applicants to the 8(a) program will meet small business size standards and be in business for more than two years. Besides being unconditionally owned and controlled by one or more disadvantaged individuals, the owners must be US citizens, who are in good standing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 31 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">HUBZone Program</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The HUBZone Program is designed to stimulate economic development and create jobs in urban and rural communities by providing federal contracting preferences to small businesses. These preferences are available to small firms who qualify because they are located in an area designated by the SBA as a historically underutilized business zone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Through the award of sole source and set-aside contracts, the HUBZone program provides market access and growth for qualified businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>\fSlide 32 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">HUBZone Program</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The HUBZone program offers benefits to eligible firms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A government-wide goal of 3% provides incentives for agencies to award contracts to certified HUBZone firms. In addition, certain contracts can be specifically set-aside for firms located within a HUBZone. And further, in some cases a 10% price evaluation preference may be applicable to a HUBZone certified firm. Review the FAR reference for clarity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 33 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">HUBZone Program</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To be eligible for the HUBZone program a firm must be a small business, meeting SBA’s small business size standards. In addition, the business must be owned and controlled by at least 51% of US citizens, or a Community Development Corporation, an agricultural cooperative, or an Indian tribe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Further, the firm’s principal office must be located within a designated HUBZone, which includes lands considered “Indian Country” and military facilities closed by the “Base Realignment and Closure Act. Importantly, the “principal office” is defined as the location where the greatest number of employees perform the majority of work. Also, at least 35% of the firm’s employees must live in a HUBZone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Use the HUBZone map to determine if your firm and employees are located in a designated HUBZone area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 34 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Women and Veterans Programs</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Women and veterans programs-no narrative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 35 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Women and Veterans Programs</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Targeted contracting programs exist to help women-owned small businesses and small businesses owned by veterans and service-disabled veterans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 36 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Woman Owned Small Business Program</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Annual government-wide contracting goals have been legislatively established for women-owned small businesses. As such, 5 percent of the total value of all prime contracts and 5 percent of all subcontracts are to be awarded to women-owned small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, the Small Business Act has been amended to authorize set-asides for women owned small businesses or economically disadvantaged women owned small businesses. These set-asides apply only to certain NAICS codes. The new program is defined as the Women Owned Small Business Contract Program or simply WOSB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 37 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">New WOSB Program</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The new WOSB program opens many doors for women entrepreneurs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fHowever, as mentioned, not all contract opportunities are eligible and there are limitations. The program is defined by several key tenets: it applies only to contracts in designated industries; only woman-owned small businesses or economically disadvantaged women-owned small businesses are eligible; competition is required for all WOSB contract awards; and, participating women-owned businesses must be certified – through a self certifying process or from an SBA approved certifier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 38 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Eligibility - New WOSB Program</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It goes without saying that only women-owned businesses are eligible for the WOSB program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A WOSB is defined as a small business that is at least 51% owned and controlled by one or more women who are US citizens. The ownership must be direct and not subject to conditions. A woman or women must manage the day to day operations of the business and be able to provide documents demonstrating that these requirements are satisfied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An economically disadvantaged woman-owned small business must satisfy all conditions for a WOSB. In addition, a woman will be presumed economically disadvantaged if she has a personal net worth of less than $750,000, her adjusted gross annual income does not exceed $350,000 and the fair market value of all of her assets does not exceed $6 million.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 39 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Certification - New WOSB Program</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Women business owners participating in the WOSB program must be certified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Certification can be accomplished in two ways – through self certification or through a third party certifier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A woman-owned small business or economically disadvantaged woman-owned small business can self certify -- to participate in the WOSB program. This can be done by first registering in the Central Contractor Registration - the CCR – and the Online Representations and Certifications Application - ORCA - as a woman-owned small business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Other documents will be requested by the contracting officer. These documents will be used to validate that the business is an eligible small business, owned and controlled by one or more women. All certification documents for WOSBs or EDWOSBs will be maintained in the WOSB Program Repository that SBA will manage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, a WOSB or EDWOSB can be certified by a third party certifier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A third party certifier is a federal agency, a state government, or a national certifying entity approved by the Small Business Administration to provide certifications of WOSBs or EDWOSBs. SBA will maintain a list of approved third party certifiers on its Website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 40 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Veterans Programs (VOSB &amp; SDVOSB)</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fThe Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999 defined veteran owned small businesses and service disabled veteran owned businesses. It also established government-wide contracting and subcontracting goals for service disabled veteran owned small businesses at 3 percent, respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Service disabled veteran owned small businesses are self-certified. However, the Department of Veterans Affairs verifies ownership and control of veteran owned small businesses and service disabled veteran owned small businesses, as part of the Vendor Information Pages or VIP database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 41 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As mentioned earlier in this training program, a contracting officer can set-aside acquisitions for service disabled veteran owned small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To participate in this type of set-aside, such businesses must be at least 51% owned and controlled by a service disabled veteran and the daily management operations of the concern must be controlled by a service-disabled veteran or caregiver. And, they must be a small business. Service disabled veteran owned small businesses are required to self-certify.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 42 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Veterans First Contracting Program</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Veterans First Contracting Program applies only to purchases made by the Department of Veterans Affairs and only veteran owned small businesses and service disabled veteran owned small businesses are eligible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Veteran owned small firms wanting to participate in the program must be certified by the Department of Veterans Affairs and listed in the VA’s Vendor Information Pages or VIP database.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 43 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Resources and Tools</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Resources and tools-no narrative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 44 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Resources and Tools</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Federal Acquisition Regulations\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>https://www.acquisition.gov/far</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Acquisition Central\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>https://www.acquisition.gov/</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>FAR Part 19 – Small Business Programs\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>http://www.acquisition.gov/far</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Code of Federal Regulations (13CFR)\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>\fhttp://www.gpoaccess.gov/cfr/index.html</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Federal Business Opportunities\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>http://www.fbo.gov</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>SBA-Government Contracting\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>http://www.sba.gov/aboutsba/sbaprograms/gc/index.html</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 45 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Resources and Tools</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Online Representations &amp; Certification Application (ORCA)\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>https://orca.bpn.gov</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn more about (including application procedures):\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>8(a) Business Development Program http://www.sba.gov/content/8a-business-development-0</li>\r\n\t\t<li>WOSB Program http://www.sba.gov/content/contracting-opportunities-women-owned-small-businesses</li>\r\n\t\t<li>HUB Zone Program http://www.sba.gov/content/hubzone-0</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Find your local:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>SBA district office http://www.sba.gov/localresources/index.html</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) http://www.aptac-us.org/new/Govt_Contracting/find.php</li>\r\n\t\t<li>SCORE chapter http://www.score.org/</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Small Business Development Center http://www.asbdc-us.org/</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Women’s Business Center http://www.awbc.biz/locate.asp</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 46 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Conclusion</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thank you for participating in Part 1, of the GC 101 training program.

This part, part two, discusses the steps used by the government to purchase what it needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Parts one and three provide clarity and training around prime and subcontract assistance programs, SBA certification programs, women and veteran owned small business programs and how to sell to the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 3 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Learning Objectives</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After reviewing this training program you should:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Understand the contracting methods used by government contracting officers to buy goods and services.</li>\r\n\t<li>Know about types of contracts and agreements.</li>\r\n\t<li>Understand key parts of the FAR. And,</li>\r\n\t<li>Know where to find additional contracting resources.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 4 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How the Government Buys</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How the Government Buys – no narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 5 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How the Government Buys</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The government applies standardized procedures to buy products and services it needs from suppliers who meet certain qualifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Contracting officials use procedures outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, commonly known as the FAR, to guide government purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fThe primary contracting methods used by the government are: micro-purchases; simplified acquisition procedures; sealed bidding; contract by negotiations; and, consolidated purchasing programs, such as the use of GSA schedules, Government Wide Acquisition Contracts and other multiple award vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each of these contracting methods is discussed in the following.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 6 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Credit Card Opportunities</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Generally speaking, government purchases of individual items under $3,000.00 are considered micro- purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such government buys do not require competitive bids or quotes and agencies can simply pay using a Government Purchase Card or credit card, without the involvement of a procurement officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is important to note, about 70 percent of all government procurement transactions are for micro- purchases under$3,000 and are facilitated with a credit card. In fiscal year 2010, this represented over $19 billion dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Credit card opportunities in the government buying space are huge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 7 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Simplified Acquisition Procedures</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act and other statutory amendments removed many competition restrictions on government purchases under $150,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Agencies can use simplified procedures for soliciting and evaluating bids up to $150,000. Government agencies, however, are still required to advertise all planned purchases over $25,000 in Federal Business Opportunities or the FBO (www.fedbizopps.gov), the government’s online listing and database of available procurement opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Simplified acquisition procedures require fewer administrative details, fewer approval levels, and less documentation. The procedures require all federal purchases above $3,000, but under $150,000, to be reserved for small businesses, an important point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This small business set-aside applies, unless the contracting official cannot obtain offers from two or more small firms who are competitive on price, quality and delivery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 8 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sealed Bidding</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sealed bidding is how the government buys competitively when its requirements are very specific, clear and complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An IFB or “Invitation For Bid” is the method used for the sealed bid process. Typically, an IFB includes a description of the product or service to be acquired, instructions for preparing a bid, the conditions for purchase, delivery, payment and other requirements associated with the bid, including a deadline for bid submissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fEach sealed bid is opened in a public setting by a government contracting officer, at the time designated in the invitation. All bids are read aloud and recorded. A contract is then awarded by the agency to the lowest bidder who is determined to be fully responsive to the needs of the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Government-wide IFBs are available daily for review in the government’s online listing service, Federal Business Opportunities. This electronic service, which is discussed in detail later, also provides direct links to available IFB invitations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 9 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Contracting by Negotiations</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Contracting by negotiation is used in many federal procurement actions. This is typically a more complicated process for companies wanting to sell to the government. It is also a method that is more time consuming for buying agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is how it works..... In certain cases, when the value of a government contract exceeds $150,000 and when it necessitates a highly technical product or service, the government may issue a Request for Proposal. In a typical RFP, the government will request a product or service it needs, and solicit proposals from prospective contractors on how they intend to carry out that request, and at what price. Proposals in response to an RFP can be subject to negotiation after they have been submitted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When the government is merely checking into the possibility of acquiring a product or service, it may issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ). A response to an RFQ by a prospective contractor is not considered an offer, and consequently, cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Government-wide RFPs and RFQs are also available daily for review in the FBO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 10 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Consolidated Purchasing Vehicles</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most government agencies have common purchasing needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sometimes the government can realize economies of scale by centralizing the purchasing of certain types of products or services. This is called consolidated purchasing and multiple award, acquisition vehicles are typically used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The most common multiple award schedules are GSA Schedules or Government Wide Acquisition Contracts, called G-WACs. These centralized buying vehicles are negotiated by the government with awards to many potential vendors and used by multiple agencies buying goods and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 11 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Types of Contracts and Agreements</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Types of contracts and agreements – no narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Slide 12 Types of Contracts and Agreements</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">OK – so we have discussed the primary buying methods used by the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fLet’s now take a look at the types of contracts and agreements that are typically used. Specifically, fixed price, cost-reimbursement, incentive contracts, indefinite delivery contracts, time and materials and labor hour contracts and agreements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 13 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fixed Price Contracts</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fixed-price contracts are the most common types of contracts that small businesses are involved with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">They provide for a firm price or, in appropriate cases, an adjustable price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A firm-fixed-price contract provides for a price that is not subject to any adjustment on the basis of the contractor’s cost experience in performing the contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A fixed-price contract with economic price adjustment provides for upward and downward revision of the stated contract price upon the occurrence of specified contingencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And finally, a fixed-price incentive contract is a contract that provides for adjusting profit and establishing the final contract price by a formula based on the relationship of final negotiated total cost to total target cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 14 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cost-Reimbursement Contracts</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cost-reimbursement contracts provide for payment of allowable incurred costs, to the extent prescribed in the contract. These contracts establish an estimate of total cost for the purpose of obligating funds and establishing a ceiling that the contractor may not exceed without the approval of the contracting officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This type of contract is used when — circumstances do not allow the agency to define its requirements sufficiently to allow for a fixed-price type contract, or uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use any type of fixed-price contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A cost contract is a contract in which the contractor receives no fee. A cost-sharing contract is a contract in which the contractor receives no fee and is reimbursed only for an agreed-upon portion of its allowable costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A cost-plus-fixed-fee contract is a contract that provides for payment to the contractor of a negotiated fee that is fixed at the inception of the contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A cost-plus-incentive-fee contract is a contract that provides for an initially negotiated fee to be adjusted later by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A cost-plus-award-fee contract is a contract that provides for a fee consisting of a base amount, fixed at inception of the contract and an award amount, based upon a judgmental evaluation by the Government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 15 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Incentive Contracts</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fIncentive contracts are appropriate when a firm-fixed-price contract is not appropriate and the required supplies or services can be acquired at lower costs and, in certain instances, with improved delivery or technical performance, by relating the amount of profit or fee payable under the contract to the contractor’s performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Incentive contracts are designed to obtain specific acquisition objectives by establishing reasonable and attainable targets that are clearly communicated to the contractor, and</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">by including appropriate incentive arrangements designed to motivate contractor efforts and discourage contractor inefficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 16 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Indefinite Delivery Contracts</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are three types of indefinite-delivery contracts: definite-quantity contracts, requirements contracts, and indefinite-quantity contracts. The appropriate type of indefinite-delivery contract may be used to acquire supplies or services when the exact times or exact quantities of future deliveries are not known at the time of contract award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Indefinite-quantity contracts are also known as delivery-order contracts or task-order contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A definite-quantity contract provides for delivery of a definite quantity of specific supplies or services for a fixed period, with deliveries or performance at designated locations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A requirements contract provides for filling actual purchase requirements for supplies or services during a specified contract period - from one contractor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An indefinite-quantity contract provides for an indefinite quantity of supplies or services during a fixed period. Quantity limits may be stated as number of units or as dollar values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 17 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Indefinite Delivery – Indefinite Quantity Contracts</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The most common type of indefinite delivery contracts are know as IDIQs or Indefinite delivery / indefinite quantity contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">IDIQ contracts are most often used for service contracts and Architect-Engineering services. Awards are usually for base years as well as option years. Agencies place delivery orders - for supplies - or task orders - for services - against a basic contract for individual requirements. An IDIQ contract is typically used when a buying facility cannot predetermine the precise quantities of supplies or services that will be required during the contract period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">IDIQ contracts are often multi-agency contracts issued as Government-Wide Acquisition Contracts or GWACs. Or, they may be government agency-specific contracts. GSA and DOD use IDIQ contracts frequently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 18 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Time and Materials – Labor Hour Contracts</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fA time-and-materials contract is designed for acquiring supplies or services on the basis of direct labor hours at specified fixed hourly rates that include wages, overhead, general and administrative expenses, and profit; and actual cost for materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A time-and-materials contract is typically only used when it is not possible -- at the time of placing the contract – to estimate accurately the extent or duration of the work, or to anticipate costs with any reasonable degree of confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A labor-hour contract is a variation of the time-and-materials contract, differing only in that materials are not supplied by the contractor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 19 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Agreements</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A basic agreement is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency or contracting activity and a contractor that contains contract clauses applying to future contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It anticipates separate future contracts that will incorporate – by reference or attachment -- the required and applicable clauses agreed upon in the basic agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A basic agreement is not a contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let’s take a look at Basic Order Agreements and Blanket Purchase Agreements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 20 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Basic Order Agreement</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A basic order agreement is a written instrument of understanding, negotiated between an agency or contracting office and a contractor, that contains: (1) terms and clauses applying to future contracts, (2) a description of supplies or services to be provided, and (3) methods for pricing, issuing, and delivering future orders under the basic order agreement. Again, the a basic order agreement is not a contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A basic order agreement may be used to expedite contracting for uncertain requirements for supplies or services when specific items, quantities, and prices are not known at the time the agreement is executed, but a substantial number of requirements -- for the type of supplies or services covered by the agreement -- are anticipated to be purchased from the contractor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 21 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Blanket Purchase Agreement</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A blanket purchase agreement is a simplified method of filling anticipated repetitive needs for supplies or services by establishing “charge accounts” with qualified sources of supply. BPAs are typically established for use by an organization or agency responsible for providing supplies for its own operations or for other offices, installations, or functions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The following are circumstances under which BPAs are established:</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is a wide variety of items in a broad class of supplies or services that are generally purchased, but the exact items, quantities, and delivery requirements are not known in advance and may vary considerably. Or, the use of this procedure would avoid the writing of numerous purchase orders. And, there is no existing contract vehicle for the same supply or service that the contracting activity is required to use.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 24 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Rules</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The rules-no narrative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 25 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Rules</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Understanding the government’s procurement rules is critical to the success of a small business wanting to participate as a government contractor. The FAR is the roadmap for doing business with the government. It outlines all of the rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is a comprehensive guide indexed by topic. It is an excellent resource tool. The most common FAR sections used by small business are:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Subpart 8.4 – Federal Supply Schedules</li>\r\n\t<li>Part 13 – Simplified Acquisitions</li>\r\n\t<li>Part 14 – Sealed Bidding</li>\r\n\t<li>Part 15 – Contracting by Negotiation</li>\r\n\t<li>Part 16 – Types of Contracts</li>\r\n\t<li>Part 19 – Small Business Programs</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 26 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Resources and Tools</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Resources and tools - no narrative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Slide 27 Resources and Tools</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Federal Acquisition Regulations\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>https://www.acquisition.gov/far</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Acquisition Central\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>https://www.acquisition.gov/</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>FAR Part 19 – Small Business Programs\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>http://www.acquisition.gov/far</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Code of Federal Regulations (13CFR)\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>http://www.gpoaccess.gov/cfr/index.html</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Federal Business Opportunities\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>http://www.fbo.gov</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>SBA-Government Contracting\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>http://www.sba.gov/aboutsba/sbaprograms/gc/index.html</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Information is power.

This part, part three, specifically discusses how to sell goods and services to the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Parts one and two provide clarity and training around government contracting and certifications programs and how the government buys goods and</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 3 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Learning Objectives</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">After reviewing this training program you should:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Have a better understanding about government contracting programs.</li>\r\n\t<li>Know how to sell goods and services to the government.</li>\r\n\t<li>Know where to find additional contracting resources.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 4 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How to sell to the government</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How to sell to the government</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 5 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Selling to the Federal Government</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A small business wanting to participate in federal government contract opportunities should engage in several foundational steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These steps include: define products and services; register in the CCR; develop a winning CCR profile; prepare a quality capability statement; market directly to agencies; find contract opportunities; subscribe to bid matching services; use procurement vehicles; and, engage a mentor or partner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each of these foundational steps is discussed in the following slides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 6 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Define Products and Services</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fGovernment agencies use the North American Industry Classification System, more commonly referred to as a NAICS code, to identify products and services by industry type. A NAICS code, or codes, identifies the products and services a company supplies. The NAICS code is a six digit number that describes a particular product or service a company supplies. A firm can have multiple NAICS codes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">NAICS codes do not uniquely identify the business. The Federal government uses D-U-N-S numbers, provided by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, to identify prospective vendors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can find the NAICS codes for your products and services by clicking on the referenced hyperlink. It is also important to note that you can use your NAICS code or codes to conduct online searches at the Websites of numerous federal agencies to learn what they are buying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To participate in contract opportunities within the Department of Defense (DOD), a firm will also need to know its Federal Supply Group or Class code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The hyperlinks provided can be used by a firm to identify appropriate NAICS codes, obtain a D-U-N-S number, and identify its appropriate Federal Supply Group. It is important that a firm properly define its products and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 7 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Register in SAM</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The System for Award Management, more commonly known as SAM, is the primary source for agencies to learn about prospective vendors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">SAM is a government-maintained free database of companies wanting to do business with the government. This database is a marketing tool for businesses and a searchable list of prospective vendors for the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A firm must register in the SAM system to participate as a seller in the federal space. Further, a firm’s profile in SAM must be updated at least once every 12 months – for the profile to stay active.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Completing an accurate and appealing small business profile in the government’s SAM system is an important, foundational step in marketing your goods and services to the federal government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 8 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Develop a Winning SAM Profile</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Registering in the SAM system is an important marketing tool for your 8(a) firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As such, you should learn as much as possible about the SAM system. That includes accessing the SAM site and performing multiple searches, as if you were looking to hire a firm similar to your own business. Review profiles of businesses in similar areas of expertise and use them as a guides when developing your own business profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Also, treat your SAM and Dynamic Small Business Profile as your business resume. And, as with any resume, it should be regularly reviewed, updated and strengthened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fFinally, get feedback. This is critical. When you talk with contracting officers, mentors and other procurement professionals ask them for a candid appraisal of your SAM profile. This information should be used to make necessary adjustments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 9 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Prepare a Quality Capability Statement</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A business should prepare and maintain a comprehensive Capability Statement that clearly outlines its management, technical and business strengths. This is important. Such a statement should include specific capabilities and skills, past performance history, awards and commendations, and resumes of key management personnel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As with your SAM profile, you should seek regular feedback on your capability statement and refine and update it accordingly. This is important</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 10 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Market Directly to Agencies</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A firm should understand that there are differences between selling to the government and selling to the private sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">However, good marketing is key. You should learn what agencies or prime contractors have a need for and then clearly demonstrate – to appropriate agencies or prime contractors -- how your business can fill specific needs and add value.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, you should participate in procurement related conferences, activities and matchmaking events. These activities will help you become known to contract “players” and to be a participant in the procurement arena.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Finally, visit your local SBA district office Website. At that site, by clicking on events – you can learn about training and networking opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 11 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Use Procurement Vehicles</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In Part 2 of the Government Contracting 101 series, we learned about consolidated purchasing programs. Under such programs, the Federal government tries to benefit from economies of scale and make it easier for vendors to sell to the government by establishing Multiple Award Schedules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">These schedules are often referred to as procurement vehicles. Two examples of this type of contracting include General Services Administration (GSA) Schedules and Government Wide Acquisition Contracts or (GWACs). Under the GSA Schedule, GSA negotiates prices and terms with prospective vendors and enters into an agreement with those vendors. Under the agreement, participating government agencies can purchase products and services from a schedule of prospective vendors, according to prices and terms already agreed to by the vendors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Procurement vehicles can be valuable tools for small businesses to gain access to contract opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>\fSlide 12 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Find Contract Opportunities</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is impossible for a small business to sell its products or services to the government, if it doesn’t know which agencies are buying, what their needs are and when they need it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To market or advertise contract opportunities to the public, the federal government operates a robust, online service called Federal Business Opportunities, but more commonly known as FBO or FedBizOpps. This single entry, government-wide Website profiles available business opportunities and is one of the most powerful tools available to help you become successful in government contracting. The online tool identifies contract opportunities over $25,000.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Firms can also view past awarded contracts in the FBO – which may help you with preparing future proposals or bids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The FBO is a very powerful tool. It is important that your business understands how to fully use all aspects of this tool. The referenced hyperlinks are very helpful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 13 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Find Subcontract Opportunities</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An alternative to seeking prime contracts is to explore subcontracting opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Subcontracting with a prime contractor can be a profitable experience as well as a growth opportunity for a business. If, after assessing the capabilities and capacity of your business, you concludes that you are not ready to bid competitively for prime contracts, you should consider opportunities available through subcontracting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To help small businesses find opportunities, SBA maintains, SUB-Net, a searchable database of available subcontract opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 14 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Subscribe to Bid-Matching Services</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To help find contract opportunities, some companies subscribe to bid-matching services. Such services provide leads on prospective contract opportunities that match a business’s qualifications. Such services do much of the work associated with finding contract opportunities, but the business still has to prepare the bid and win the contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A small business can subscribe to a free bid-matching service through its local Procurement Technical Assistance Center. Other bid-matching services are also available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 15 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Network – Learn from the Wisdom of Others</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If there is one message that is consistent throughout this presentation, it is knowledge is everything. You don’t know what you don’t know. A business can waste a lot of time and expend unnecessary resources if it doesn’t understand how to play in the federal contracting arena.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Learn from the wisdom of others. Others, who have seasoned knowledge and experience in federal contracting. Network, ask questions and cultivate relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fEngage knowledgeable people who can help guide you through the challenging aspects of trying to win federal contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 16 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Proposal Preparation</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Proposal preparation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 17 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Types of Solicitations</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As we have noted in this and other training modules, government contracting is big business with thousands of contracts -- in hundreds of billions of dollars -- being executed by the federal government each year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The bid packages used by the government usually contain a set of documents to which a bidder develops a responsive proposal. Such solicitations typically come in three primary formats or types: Request for Quote (RFQ); Request for Proposal (RFP); and Invitation for Bid (IFB). Each of these solicitation types, as well as some of the key forms required by the government are discussed in the following slides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As a helpful activity, go to the government’s FBO website and download a sampling of RFQs, RFPs and IFBs -- to familiarize yourself with their overall organization and format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 18 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Solicitation Numbers</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To better understand the types of solicitations, let’s first look at the government’s numbering system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each solicitation issued by the government is assigned a number. The number tells much about the solicitation. The first six digits identify the buying facility. The second two digits indicate the fiscal year the contract will be executed in. The alpha character defines the type of solicitation – which is both revealing and important. The R character – shown here -- indicates a request for proposal. The last four digits represent the order number.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The alpha code is further explained in the next slide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 19 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">About the Alpha Character</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The alpha character or code used in the numbering system is important to understand. Different letters mean different things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For instance, R is for request for proposal, M is purchase order, C is contract of all types, I is for sealed bid, J is reserved, T is for a request for quote under $25K, and Q is for a request for quote under $150k.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>\fSlide 20 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Request for Quotation (RFQ)</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A Request for Quotation or RFQ is the type of solicitation used by the government to obtain information and quotations, but the responses are not considered offers. This solicitation type is typically used when the estimated value of the government’s need is expected to be under $150,000 and simplified acquisition procedures will apply. An RFQ, however may also be used in some circumstances where the estimate value of the government’s need exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An RFQ bid package typically includes Standard Form 18.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 21 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Request for Proposal (RFP)</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Request for Proposals or RFPs are used in negotiated acquisitions to communicate government requirements to prospective contractors and to solicit proposals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">RFPs for competitive acquisitions will, at a minimum, describe the government's requirements, anticipated terms and conditions that will apply, information required to be in the offeror's proposal, and factors that will be used to evaluate the proposal. An RFP will result in a negotiated contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An RFP bid package typically includes Standard Form 33 or Standard Form 1447. It is important to note that some procurement systems, such as GSA’s eBuy – offer a fully electronic RFQ/RFP system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are unsure of any provision within an RFP -- ask the contracting officer for an explanation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 22 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Invitation for Bid (IFB)</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An Invitation for Bid or IFB is often referred to as a sealed bid solicitation. There are typically no discussions or negotiations with the government buying office and the bid package – when issued -- is considered complete for bidding purposes. Among qualified bidders, price is considered the key consideration by the government in awarding the contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Responsiveness to the solicitation’s terms and conditions are key to a successful bid. Be sure to complete your bid package in accordance with the instructions. Non-responsive bids will be eliminated from consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An IFB bid package typically includes Standard Form 33 or Standard Form 1447.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 23 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Uniform Contract Format</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For most RFPs and IFBs, where simplified acquisition procedures are NOT applied, the government requires the use of a uniform contract format. This format is described in the noted Far references and contains four parts and multiple sections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fPart I contains section A which includes the use of Standard Form 33, Standard Form 26 or Standard Form 1447. In some circumstances it may also include SF 18 – which is a Request for Quotations. Sections B – H include a list of supplies and services to be acquired, the statement of work, packaging requirements, inspection and acceptance specifics, delivery and performance requirements, and any special provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Some of the provisions may only be incorporated by reference. However, you should go to the FAR to read those provisions to avoid any unpleasant surprises later on. Be sure you understand what you will be expected to do if you receive the contract award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 24 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Uniform Contract Format (cont)</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Part II, section I, contains the clauses required by law or the FAR that govern the specific contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Part III, section J, contains a list of all attachments applicable to the contract. And, Part IV, sections K–M include information about representations and certifications – such as 8(a) certifications – required of offerors, instructions, conditions and notices to offerors, and importantly, section M outlines the evaluation factors that will be used to evaluate the award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is important to note ----- contract solicitations for bids estimated to be below the simplified acquisition threshold or $150,000 will use a streamlined contract format and may or may not use some of the parts and sections outlined in the uniform contract format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 25 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A Closer Look at Key Standard Forms</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Let’s take a closer look at the specific government standard forms and when they are used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 26 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Standard Form 33</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Standard Form 33, Solicitation, Offer and Award is the solicitation/contract form used by the federal government, not only to solicit orders, but also to award a contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is a bilateral document, such that the bidder signs the document and submits it to the government. Then, upon acceptance of the bid, the government signs the same document and a binding contract is established.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This form is used for either sealed bids or negotiated contracts valued at $150,000 or more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Slide 27 Standard Form 1449</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Except in circumstances where an electronic solicitation is used, Standard Form 1449, Solicitation/Contract/Order for Commercial Items is the form used by the government to buy commercial items that are estimated to have a value of less than $150,000 and simplified acquisition procedures will be applied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 28 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Standard Form 1447</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fStandard Form 1447, Solicitation/Contract is used in connection with negotiated acquisitions when simplified acquisition procedures will apply. It may also be used in lieu of Standard Form 26 or Standard Form 33.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 29 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Standard Form 18</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Standard Form 18, Request for Quotation is the form used by the government – when quotations are not solicited electronically -- to obtain information and quotations, but the responses are not considered offers. An RFQ package is typically used when the estimated contract value is less than $150,000 and simplified acquisition procedures will be applied. Importantly, an RFQ may also be used for quotation requests that have an estimated value above $150,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Standard Form 26 is sometimes used to award a contract resulting from the use of Standard Form 18.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 30 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Standard Form 26</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Standard Form 26, Award/Contract is the form used by the federal government to award a contract, usually as a result of a Request for Quotation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In general, this form is similar to Standard Form 33, although it requires additional certification information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 31 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How to Write the Proposal</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Just thinking about responding to a government RFP or solicitation can be stressful. Writing the proposal, well that can make you even more anxious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It doesn’t have to be that way. Preparing a response to a government procurement request or invitation is an important task, not necessarily a daunting one. It should be approached with diligence and professionalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Writing a successful proposal is about doing your homework, preparing and responding clearly and appropriately, aligning your proposal with the government’s needs and articulating what makes you the best solution provider. These elements are critical to successful proposal writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 32 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Review the Solicitation and Rules</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Preparation is key...</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are going to respond to a government RFP or other type of procurement request, you must be prepared, or you will likely just be wasting your time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fCarefully read the solicitation, including all applicable schedules, clauses and attachments. This is important. The solicitation is designed to provide prospective bidders with all of the information needed to write a successful proposal. The agency that prepared the solicitation expects you to read and follow it carefully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Also, make sure you review and understand the regulations (FAR Parts) governing the specific type of solicitation you plan to respond to. Some of the regulatory references relevant to the solicitation and proposal process are highlighted in this slide. If possible, assemble a team to review and prepare the proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Keep in mind, these are only some references. Other regulatory or policy guidance may be applicable to the specific procurement you are considering. Talk with your BOS, PTAC or a contracting officer for more assistance. Some PTACs and SBDCs offer training on how to prepare and submit proposals. Consider taking such training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 33 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Prepare and Respond Appropriately</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Responding appropriately to a solicitation follows from reading and understanding the government’s request. Solicitations are usually very specific and follow a uniform contract format. It is important that you respond, as you are asked – answering all questions, providing all information and following all schedules in the order, time-frame and structure requested. Eliminate any guesswork by ensuring that each response is appropriately identified so the reviewer can readily recognize the section of the RFP which is being addressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This may sound like common sense and it is. But, you would be surprised to learn how many proposals submitted to the government that are received after the due-date and that do not respond to what was asked for, or requested. Responding appropriately is important!</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 34 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Align Proposal with the Government’s Needs</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A good proposal will clearly articulate how the bidder can solve the problem or fill the need outlined in the government’s solicitation. This again, follows from understanding the nature of the procurement request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Understanding the government’s need is important. Even more important, however is how your firm plans to execute or deliver an appropriate solution. It is, after all about convincing a government review panel that your proposal solves a specific problem or need and is the best fit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A proposal may look good and read well, but if it is not clearly aligned with fulfilling the government’s needs, it will likely fall behind other more substantive, solution focused proposals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Don’t get caught up in telling a great story about your company, focusing too much on “we can do the work.” What really matters is substantiating how you can do the specific work that is needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>\fSlide 35 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Articulate What Makes You the Best Solution</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A typical government solicitation requires the bidder to provide a great deal of information. The key is pulling it all together in a proposal package that clearly describes why your company offers the best solution and is the best fit to perform the work. Think capture management....... There is no magic bullet. It comes down to doing a lot of things right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It’s about: understanding the solicitation and responding appropriately; clearly demonstrating how your firm can best fulfill the government’s need; offering pricing that is fair and competitive; making sure your proposal is well-written and error free; showing evidence of success through past performance; and finally, interweaving an amazing story throughout all parts of the proposal, including the executive summary – that makes a compelling case for your firm as the best solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 36 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What to Avoid</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sometimes learning from others provides the best lessons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With regards to solid proposal preparation, some key things to avoid include: not fully understanding the solicitation and governing regulations; submitting an incomplete or late submission; not providing specificity or focus; highlighting too much fluff and not enough substance, not understanding best value considerations; unrealistic pricing; failure to address evaluation factors; and errors in the submission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you aren’t selected for a contract, consider asking for a debriefing to learn where you may have gone wrong and what you can do to improve your future proposals. Done in a professional manner, this can be a way to show contracting staff of your willingness to improve and to be more responsive to the government’s needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 37 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cost and Pricing</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Cost and pricing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 38 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Introduction to Contract Pricing</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Contract pricing is an important aspect of procurement and a particularly important component in developing a strategy to win federal contracts. There are two sides to this issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">First, the government’s perspective. Federal contracting officers are responsible for ensuring that government agencies purchase supplies and services from responsible sources at fair and reasonable prices. As such and to accomplish this, most contracting officers and agency buyers conduct considerable market research to better understand markets and pricing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A contractor will likely have a related, but different perspective. An 8(a) firm, or any company for that matter wanting to do business with the government is responsible for developing a contract pricing strategy that is reasonable, competitive, but profitable. The typical contract \fbidder wants to make as much as possible in profit, but at the same time be competitive and win the bid. As such, with contracting officers doing considerable market research and a high number of firms competing for federal contracts, pricing is an important variable. A variable that can make or break your success in federal contract markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 39 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Negotiated Contracts vs. Sealed Bid Contracts</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As discussed earlier, there are two fundamental contract categories: negotiated contracts and sealed bid contracts. The distinction between the two is important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The FAR states that any contract awarded using other than sealed bidding procedures is considered a negotiated contract. Procedures for contracting by sealed bidding require the government to evaluate bids without discussions and award to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the invitation for bids, will be most advantageous to the government considering only price and price related factors. Negotiations are not permitted prior to the contract award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Procedures for contracting by negotiation permit negotiations prior to contract award. However, a solicitation under procedures for contracting by negotiation may or may not actually include negotiations. For example, the instructions to offerors may include the provision, the “Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions.\" When that provision is used, actual negotiations are not permitted unless the contracting officer determines in writing that they are necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The pricing you propose in response to a government solicitation will be influenced by your ability to negotiate or not negotiate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 40 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Regulatory Guidance</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">How you analyze your costs and price your proposal is primarily up to you, as long as you follow applicable government rules and guidelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Federal rules for negotiated and sealed bid contracts and contracts that follow simplified acquisition procedures are outlined in FAR parts, 15, 14 and 13, respectively. Also, highlighted in the slide are FAR subparts that are pricing related.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is important to note, in addition to FAR guidance, other agency pricing guidelines or policies may also apply for specific contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 41 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pricing Approach</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The pricing approach used by bidders for products and services being procured, besides following specific contract rules, is pretty typical, but unique to the business doing the pricing. That is, individual business costs and other considerations are factored into pricing formulas that are typical or generally used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fFor instance, with regards to product pricing, a firm would typically consider and add material costs, plus labor costs, plus estimated overhead expenses, plus a profit margin to arrive at a price it would propose or charge for the product being delivered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Regarding the pricing of a service, a firm would typically consider and add estimated hourly overhead expenses, plus hourly wages, plus a profit margin to arrive at a price it would propose or charge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is important to point out, that some government solicitations and contracts are very unique regarding costs and pricing and specific cost and pricing requirements may apply. Carefully review all government requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 42 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Important Pricing Considerations</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Contract pricing is a critical component in developing a strategy to win federal contracts. A successful pricing strategy will: learn from past contracts; consider all costs -- even special requirements; factor best value considerations; include bidding costs; and, importantly allow for sufficient overhead expenses and profit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If a solicitation is using a ‘best value’ approach, the contracting officer may not make an award to the offeror providing the lowest price, rather an award will be made to that offeror who is providing the government with an approach that best meets the government’s needs. While price is always a consideration, in a best value scenario it doesn’t have to be the primary consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 43 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Resources and Tools</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Resources and tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 44 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Resources and Tools</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Information is power. Numerous resources are available to help you better understand government contracting programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 45 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Resources and Tools</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Learn from these resources and use them as tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 46 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Contact Us...</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thank you for participating in Part 3, of the GC 101 training program.

Visit the resource icon in the course player or locate additional tools, templates, and mentors on SBA.gov once you finish the course.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s get started!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.4 Growing Smart&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’re thinking about expanding your business, that’s probably a good sign that your business is successful, and you are looking to make more money or take on additional challenges. Like starting a business, expanding isn’t as simple as just turning the key and opening the doors. Successful expansion results from good forethought and planning. Knowing when to expand is the first step in growing your business. Let’s start by taking a look at some of the ways to evaluate your business needs and determine if you are ready to expand your business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.5 S.W.O.T Analysis&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way to evaluate the potential for growth in your company is with a S.W.O.T. analysis. S.W.O.T. stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. S.W.O.T. looks at internal factors-factors within your business-and external factors-factors outside your business-to help you make an informed decision. Select each letter in S.W.O.T. to learn some of the questions you should ask when evaluating each aspect of a S.W.O.T. analysis.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When evaluating your business’ strengths, ask yourself the following questions: Considering all your resources (human, mechanical, financial, etc.), where does your business excel? What are your assets? What are your core competencies? Where is your business most profitable? Do your revenue streams and profits indicate that you are ready to expand?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When evaluating your business’ weaknesses, ask yourself the following questions: Similarly considering your resources, where does your business need to improve? What needs are you not meeting effectively? Will those weaknesses slow down your growth, or will they become amplified during the expansion process? Where are you losing money? Where do you lack resources?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When evaluating your business’ opportunities, ask yourself the following questions: Where are the best areas to expand your business? Are there areas that your competition are not covering that you could? Do your customers have new needs that are not being met? Are there economic, political, or social factors that could improve your marketability? Are there technological advances that you can start using to improve efficiency?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When evaluating your business’ threats, ask yourself the following questions: Are your competitors expanding in a way that could affect your market share? Are there economic, political, or social factors that could negatively affect your marketability?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.6 The Cost of Expansion&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Expansion of your business will mean additional expenses. Similar to when you started your business, there will be initial costs, whether for equipment, building space, or personnel.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure you understand and accurately predict the costs of expansion. You want as few surprises as possible during this process. This is especially important if you need to find outside financing for your expansion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.7 Business Changes&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Expansion will result in changes to all aspects of your organization, including your assets, personnel, operations, and even your leadership of the company. It is important to keep this in mind as you anticipate the needs of your business in its growth stage. Select each item to learn more about how growing your business will affect these different areas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than likely, growing your company will require you to increase your assets as well. This could mean acquiring new machinery or equipment, or new leases on property.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you are expanding to a new location or adding products and services, you will most likely need to increase the number of employees you have. Do you have current employees who have shown they can handle increased responsibility and take over some of the things you currently manage? Will you need to hire experienced professionals for things you may currently handle such as accounting or information technology? If you are expanding your product or service line, you will need to train your employees on the new products or services. Where will you focus your personal efforts and where will you need your employees to step up and help?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider how the expansion will affect your operations. Some of the changes will be obvious, like the inclusion of new equipment or new processes. However, you should also think about how your existing processes will change. Will the expansion affect the demand for your existing products or services, and if so, how will that affect the way you deliver them? Will you need new permits or licenses? How will your employees spend their time, and how will expansion affect the way they perform their daily tasks?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How will your impact on the business transition? Will you still be providing most of the services, or will you be more of a big-picture visionary? How will the expansion affect the amount of time you have to complete business-related tasks? Which of your current tasks will you delegate to your employees? How will you empower your employees to lead others?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.8 How Does Expansion Support Your Vision&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with any significant business decision that you make, you should ensure that your proposed expansion is in line with your vision or mission. While expansion into other markets and diversifying your product can be a great way-even a critical way-to expand, don’t lose sight of the direction you intend for your company. If you determine that your expansion is outside your current mission or vision statement, then you may consider revising these statements. However, doing so should not be taken lightly. Choosing the wrong method of expansion can confuse the consumer or your employees as to the message of the company, and ultimately compromise not only your growth strategy, but your core competencies as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.9 Is Expansion Optional or Necessary?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes expansion is a way to grow a business you have loved, and a way to create new and interesting challenges for yourself as a business owner. However, other times expansion could be critical to the future success of your business. For example, if you are no longer able to meet production demands because you are too busy or overwhelmed, or you are turning away potential customers, you may need to expand your personnel or facilities to accommodate the increased demand. Likewise, if your competition is expanding and taking away business from you, you may need to grow in order to maintain your market share.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.10 Growth Strategies&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many ways that you can grow your business. However, these generally fall under one of three categories: expanding your target market with your current product or service, expanding your product or service line, and taking market share from your competitors in your current market. Let’s explore these strategies in-depth, starting with expanding your target market.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.11 Expand Your Target Market&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way to grow your company is to target other markets for your product. Doing this will increase your customer base, giving you access to additional sources of revenue. You may pursue selling in a new geographic location or trying to entice new and different customer types within your current location. The internet makes global markets accessible, allowing you to expand without leaving the comfort of your current location! Let’s take a look at some of the different ways you can expand your target market.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.12 Open Another Location&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on your business model, opening another location may be the first option you consider when thinking about expanding your business into a new market. It is possibly the safest. Once you have your first location running like a well-oiled machine, you might consider opening a different location. If you decide to open a different location, you must consider the effect it will have on your original location and the cost of expansion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.13 Sell to International Customers&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>International markets make up over 70% of the overall market for goods and services, so there is a lot of potential to tap into there. Obviously, there are many logistical issues to work through as well. But done successfully, international expansion can vastly expand your customer base. Ask yourself the following when thinking about international expansion:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- What other countries might be easiest to expand to? Consider English-speaking countries or other countries where you already speak the language.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- What other countries might like your product the best?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- What are the laws governing exports to the country you’re considering? What items are restricted?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you begin to expand to foreign markets, start slow. Test your product on a small scale and see how the market responds to your product and advertising. Learn what works, change what doesn’t, roll things out slowly. Put yourself in a position to adjust quickly with minimal impact if expansion doesn’t work. If this is your first time exporting, seek the advice of others with experience. Having a trusted partner or mentor can greatly increase your chance for success.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.14 Expand to the Internet&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the Internet as a marketplace is a great way to get access to a larger market. Consider selling using your own website, or you can leverage existing online marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, or countless others with merchant programs.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However you opt to do business, your market presence will be critically important for online sales. Wherever you choose to show your product, your web presence should address the following:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Answer the question \"Why should I do business with you?\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Make it easy to order&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Have an \"About Us\" or \"Contact Us\" area and make sure customers can quickly find a way to contact you with questions&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Have clear shipping and return policies&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Make sure your store is mobile accessible&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.15 Target Other Customers in Your Area&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Targeting other local markets is another relatively safe growth strategy. Typically in this situation, you will have been conducting business in the area, but want to target a new customer base. In this case, make sure your product or services can be easily repositioned to appeal to these new customers. Leverage what you already know about what you provide to meet the needs of the new market. Ask yourself:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- How much similarity is there between my current customer base and the new customers I hope to target? It is good if your new target market is similar to your current one, and the more overlap there is, the more likely your expansion will succeed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- In what ways do my new target customers differ from my current customer base? What will I need to change to meet their needs?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- What other companies are targeting my new customer base? How are they performing? How will this competition affect the success of my expansion?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.16 Expand Your Product or Service Line&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another growth strategy is expanding your product or service line. Diversification is often an excellent way of growing your business. Successful diversification can provide you multiple and complimentary streams of revenue that may offset each other in slower or seasonal periods. Two examples of diversification that we will discuss briefly are selling other products or services, and franchising. Select each button to learn more about these examples.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the easiest ways to diversify and expand is by selling complimentary products or services. It is a good way to keep in line with your mission or vision and give your customers the option to view you as a “one stop shop” for your product or service. The consumer and your employees can clearly see the connection between the expansion area and your core capabilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way to add to what your business offers is to sell your business model rather than your products or services. Here, you will end up expanding your products (as your business itself becomes your product) and your target market. This strategy is called franchising. A franchise is a legal agreement between the owner of a business trademark and another individual wanting to use that trademark for his or her own business. In order to be a viable franchise, your business must be easily replicated and easy to share and teach. Additionally, you will need significant capital in order to finance the legal costs associated with setting up a franchise-likely $250,000 or more. For these reasons, franchising is rarely a good option for expansion. However, if you think your business meets these criteria you might consider it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.17 Take Market Share from Your Competitors&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final growth strategy we will talk about is Taking Market Share from your Competitors in your existing market. Growing in your existing market is a good strategy because you know the nature of the market and how your product- or service-line fits into that market. Select each button to more about some specific strategies in this area.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When expanding your current market share, focus on researching what your competitors offer and determine how you can adjust your business to make it more appealing to customers in the current market.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find another, complementary business in your area and work with the owner to increase your market share, to the benefit of both businesses. Your alliance partner should have knowledge in an area that you don’t and be related to your field of business. Likewise, you should be able to bring certain skills, abilities, or products to the alliance that will benefit your partner. Avoid the pitfalls of such alliances by setting up communication guidelines and having clear expectations of the role of each partner in the alliance. Make sure both partners are working toward a common goal, and not two goals that are closely related.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If it makes sense for your business model, consider expanding your market share into the public sector. Government contracts are often steady, stable work. They are diverse, with some catering to niche markets, small business size, and other criteria. If you are interested in government contracts, check out SBA’s Contracting Support for Small Businesses at the link on the screen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.18 Developing a Growth Plan&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with any major business decision, you should not attempt growth or expansion without careful planning. You should:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Be clear about the goals of your expansion,&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Be able to predict your revenues and expenses to an acceptable degree of certainty, and&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Understand the ways in which the expansion will change your business needs and practices.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your Growth Plan should identify your target market and how you intend to reach them. The next slides will talk more about developing your growth plan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.19 Set Goals&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Setting clear revenue and timeline goals for your expansion will help you regularly evaluate its success. You should set realistic goals for when you expect to see results from your growth plan. If these goals are not being met, then you should make adjustments or considering abandoning the project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.20 Modify Your Business Plan&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on the method of expansion you choose, you may want to modify your business plan to reflect the changes in your company. It is a good idea because it will help you think through the changes you may need to make as a result of the expansion. In some cases, this will be necessary if you want to apply for financing. Potential lenders will want to see how the funds will be used and your strategy for marketing your expansion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.21 Adapt Personnel&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Develop a plan to address your new personnel needs as a result of your expansion. Will you need more divisions in management? Who will your managers be? Will you hire from outside or are there current employees that are positioned to be promoted? How many additional employees will you need to cover the added workload of expansion?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What if you have been the sole operator of your company? Will expansion require you to start hiring employees? If so, you will need to be prepared to handle issues like payroll, benefits, and other legal requirements surrounding employees. Will you outsource payroll and other HR functions? How will you empower your new employees to make decisions that you are used to making?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.22 Develop a Market Plan&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with your business plan, you should create a new marketing plan that explains how you will reach your new customers. Updating your marketing plan is not only good practice, but it may be required by lenders. Your marketing plan should include information about your marketing budget and your expected Return on Investment (ROI) for your marketing strategy. It should outline how you will track the effectiveness of your marketing plan. In this way, you will know where to increase or decrease funding for your marketing strategies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.23 Leverage Technology&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are lots of systems available to the small business owner to help streamline your growth. Whether it’s accounting software, planning software, time-tracking software, or e-mail management, there are online systems and services that can manage much of your workflow and add efficiency to your business. You should also consider outsourcing certain functions like web design or book-keeping.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.24 Identify Financing for Growth&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many ways to finance the additional costs. The first thing you should consider is your cash flow. See if there is a way you can use it more effectively to free up money needed to expand. If not, there are several financing options available through banks and other lending institutions, many of which are guaranteed by the SBA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some guidelines to consider when looking for financing:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- You can get the best rates on loans when you anticipate your needs, rather than waiting until you are pressed for cash.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Your needs are most critical during transitional periods, so plan your growth around your seasonal activity or business cycles.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Have a clear plan for your expansion or growth and be prepared to explain it. Lenders will want to understand the specific needs of your business before they lend you money.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- On a similar note, make sure you have a business plan, as lenders will want to assess that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Again, understanding your personnel is important because lenders may also assess your management team.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- You may also consider new, non-traditional ways of raising capital, such as crowd-funding. This typically involves getting smaller amounts of money from many different sources in exchange for the promise of early prototypes or exclusive access to your products or services.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Look for venture capitalists who are looking to invest money in growing or expanding companies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.25 SUMMARY&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have completed the course on Growing an Established Company. Now you should be able to:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Identify the indicators that your business is ready to expand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Identify three ways to expand your business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Describe the different parts of a growth plan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, just like starting a business, the successful growth of your company requires careful planning and strategizing, knowing your market, and setting realistic goals that are in line with your company’s vision or mission.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.26 Next Steps&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now it’s time to apply what you’ve learned to your own business. Start by evaluating your business to see if you are ready to expand. Consider using the S.W.O.T. analysis you learned in this course. Then you should identify the best way to grow your business. Once you have decided, then create a growth plan that outlines how you will expand and how you will approach the changes that will occur to your business as a result of growth. Remember, you are not alone! If you’d rather talk to someone, the SBA has a broad network of skilled counselors and business development specialists waiting to help you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.27 Resources&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA has a broad network of skilled counselors and business development specialists.

HUBZone areas or HUBZone designations are typically areas of low median household incomes or high unemployment, or both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This mini-primer is about helping firms to better understand what HUBZone designations are, how they are determined, where they are located and how to find them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 3 Program Purpose</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But first, and importantly, the HUBZone program has one purpose: to help small businesses in both urban and rural communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It provides federal contracting assistance to qualified small firms located in historically underutilized business zones -- or HUBZones -- to increase employment opportunities, stimulate capital investment in those areas, and empower communities through economic leveraging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 4 What is a HUBZone Designation?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, what is a HUBZone designation? It is a geographical location identified and designated by the SBA as an area that is and has been historically underutilized by businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 5 Determining HUBZone Designations – SBA’s Role</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA uses information and data from multiple federal sources to determine HUBZone designated status. Such federal agencies include the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Department of Defense, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Bureau of Indian Affairs and the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way SBA uses this data to determine HUBZone areas is established by law. The agency does not have the authority to decide, without supporting data that a particular area should or should not be a designated HUBZone.&nbsp; This is an important distinction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 6 How Do You Find HUBZone Designated Areas?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How do you find a HUBZone designated area or determine if a location is in a HUBZone?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA has created an electronic tool – HUBZone Maps - where you can insert the address and zip code of a specific location (or its coordinates) to determine if that location is in a HUBZone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At you convenience, return to this slide or the resource section at the end of the course and use the hyperlink to access the HUBZone Maps, page. This page will help you determine if your business location and employees are located within a HUBZone area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can access the interactive maps from this page, but be sure to check the notice on the landing page for areas that have not been incorporated into the map yet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 7 Types of HUBZone Designations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are four types of HUBZone designations. They are: qualified census tract; qualified nonmetropolitan county; qualified Indian reservation; and, qualified base closure area. Each of these designation types is explained in the following.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 8 Qualified Census Tract (QCT)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A census tract is a <em>statistical subdivision </em>of counties that may include a few neighborhoods in a city or, in rural areas, may include several towns. Tracts generally have populations that range in size between 1,200 and 8,000 people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development is responsible for designating Qualified Census Tracts or QCTs for purposes of the statutorily established Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program. To qualify under this program, a census tract must either: demonstrate a poverty rate of at least 25 percent; or 50 percent or more of its householders must have incomes below 60 percent of the area median household income.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to note, the Low Income Tax Credit program, which is driven by statute, imposes limits on the number of census tracts an area can have. As such, it is possible for a tract to meet one or both of the above criteria, but not be designated as a QCT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 9 Qualified Nonmetropolitan County (QNMC)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only counties in nonmetropolitan areas may be eligible for HUBZone designated status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order for a nonmetropolitan county to qualify: the median household income in the county must be less than 80% of the nonmetropolitan state median household income, or the unemployment rate in the county must be at least 140% of either the national or state unemployment rate, or the county is</p>\r\n\r\n<p>classified as a Difficult Development Area, as designated by HUD within Alaska, Hawaii, or any territory or possession of the United States, outside of the 48 contiguous states.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 10 Qualified Indian Reservation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indian lands in areas within the boundaries of an Indian reservation may qualify as a HUBZone area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trust lands acquired by an Indian reservation or tribe after December 21, 2000, do not qualify as HUBZones, unless they are part of a former Reservation, or they are contiguous to areas that were trust lands prior to December 21, 2000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 11 Qualified Base Closure (QBC)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certain base closure areas may qualify as HUBZone designated areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A base closure area is defined as the lands within the boundaries of a military installation that was closed. Such an area can be designated as a HUBZone for a period of 5 years, beginning on the official date of the base closure and ending the same date, five years later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 12 Redesignated Area</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A redesignated area qualifies for a limited time as a HUBZone area. This is an important distinction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If or when a tract or county ceases to meet the qualifications for HUBZone status, due to changes in income, unemployment, or poverty data, it becomes a redesignated area. As a redesignated area, it qualifies as a HUBZone designated area for a period of three years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, when a tract or county is redesignated, its status in the HUBZone maps reflects the sunset date of the redesignation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 13 Redesignated Area - Example</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this example, Catron County, New Mexico is redesignated until October 2015, which means it ceased to be qualified in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As such, on or after October 1, 2015, all certified HUBZone small businesses whose principal office is located in Catron County, NM will be proposed for decertification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 14 Knowledge Review – Question</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Question: All of the colors in the noted HUBZone map legend indicate an area that is a HUBZone, except for one&nbsp; --&nbsp; which is it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 15 Knowledge Review – Answer</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, so that was a pretty easy question. The answer is: gray indicates a non-qualified county where there is no qualified or redesignated census tract, Indian Land, or base closure area and thus, is not a HUBZone area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 16 How Often Do HUBZones Change?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>HUBZone designations are not static. They change based on a variety of data. Indian lands and base closure areas can change frequently or as necessary. Nonmetropolitan counties are reviewed and can change multiple times a year. Census tracts are updated every five years, when HUD releases a notice to that effect in the federal register. The last update to qualified census tracts was in October of 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 17 Resources and Tools</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some very powerful resources and tools available to assist you to better understand the HUBZone program, and more specifically, HUBZone designations. Use these resources – highlighted in the following slides -- to learn, discover and expand your understanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 18 HUBZone Statute</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The HUBZone program was established by the authority 15 U.S.C. 632(a), as amended in the Small Business Act.&nbsp; Take a look at the law.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 19 HUBZone Regulations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regulations governing the HUBZone program are located in 13 CFR Parts 126.100 to 126.900. Slide 20 HUBZone Maps</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA’s HUBZone maps tool is a powerful resource. Use it to check the HUBZone status of a particular location and/or use the landing page of the tool to download relevant spreadsheets, pdfs, and other information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 21 eMail Alerts</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sign up for eMail Alerts to be notified when there is a map change. This is a helpful feature and excellent resource for learning about designation changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 22 HUBZone Designation FAQs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Review SBA’s frequently asked questions, specific to designations and the HUBZone program. Slide 23 Geocoding Toolkit</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use this geocoding toolkit if you have trouble finding an address. Slide 24 SBA/HUBZone Website</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA’s website is a comprehensive and excellent source of current information about the HUBZone program.&nbsp; Check it out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 25 GC Classroom</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The agency’s online Government Contracting Classroom features a number free training courses about government contracting and several are specific to the HUBZone program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 26 Contact Us…</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about HUBZone designations.

Welcome to SBA’s training module, <strong><em>HUBZone Eligibility Requirements </em></strong>-- <strong>Principal Office, Employees and Residency</strong>.&nbsp; This module is the second, in a series of mini-primers about the HUBZone program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 2 Introduction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The HUBZone program is designed to help small businesses -- in certain urban, rural, BRAC, Indian reservation, and difficult development areas outside the U.S. mainland – to gain access to federal procurement opportunities. HUBZone areas or HUBZone designations are typically areas of low median household incomes or high unemployment, or both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This mini-primer is designed to help firms to better understand HUBZone eligibility requirements, specifically, requirements that pertain to the location of the firm’s principal office and requirements concerning the firm’s employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 3 Program Purpose</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But first, and importantly, the HUBZone program has one purpose: to help small businesses in both urban and rural communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It provides federal contracting assistance to qualified small firms located in historically underutilized business zones -- or HUBZones -- to increase employment opportunities, stimulate capital investment in those areas, and empower communities through economic leveraging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 4 How the Program Works</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. Small Business Administration regulates and implements the HUBZone program. As such, SBA determines which businesses are eligible for the program, maintains a listing of qualified HUBZone small businesses that can be used by federal agencies to fulfill procurement needs and adjudicates protests of eligibility regarding HUBZone contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Status protests are those that deal with compliance of the principal office, 35% employee HUBZone residency and/or ownership and control requirements.&nbsp; Size protests are handled by another SBA office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 5 Eligibility Requirements</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To be eligible for the HUBZone program a business must meet specific criteria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is: it must be a small business by SBA standards and, if applicable, together with affiliates it must also be a small business; it must be directly owned and controlled by at least 51% U.S. citizens or a community development corporation, an agricultural cooperative, or an Indian tribe; its principal office must be located within a designated HUBZone, which includes lands considered “Indian country” and military facilities closed by the Base Realignment and Closure Act; and, at least 35% of its employees must reside in a HUBZone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 6 Training Focus</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The focus of this training is to review principal office location requirements and requirements surrounding the “35 percent rule.” These requirements are often misunderstood. In fact, some 85 percent of the firms initially declined for HUBZone certification, or decertified after being approved were declined or decertified because of a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the principal office location and/or employee residency requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To understand these two important eligibility tenets, the requirements concerning who is considered a HUBZone employee must be clearly understood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 7 Employees</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topic Divide – Requirements concerning employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 8 Who are Considered HUBZone Firm Employees? Who are considered HUBZone firm employees?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under HUBZone regulatory guidelines, the term “employee” means all individuals employed on a full- time, part-time, or other basis, so long as that individual works a minimum of 40 hours per month. This includes temporary employees and co-employed employees working under a professional employer organization agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Volunteers are not considered employees. However, the following individuals are not volunteers and need to be counted as employees: those who have a deferred compensation agreement or receive in- kind compensation; and, those who have an ownership interest in and work for the HUBZone firm a minimum of 40 hours per month, even if they do not receive any compensation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if an owner receives compensation but only works 20 hours per month, that owner will not be considered as an employee, even if the owner gets paid for the work. SBA has developed a series of Frequently Asked Questions – referenced in the noted hyperlink – that answer questions such as: How should I count an employee who is on leave at the time my firm is being reviewed for HUBZone compliance?&nbsp; Or, how do I count seasonal employees?&nbsp; Many other questions are also considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This FAQ resource, as well as the regulatory reference, can be very helpful. Slide 9 Employee / Independent Contractor</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When is an independent contractor considered an employee?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA will consider the totality of the circumstances, including criteria used by the IRS for Federal income tax purposes and those set forth in SBA's Size Policy Statement No. 1, in determining whether individuals are employees of a concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of whether your firm labels an individual an independent contractor, you must still determine if that individual should be treated as an employee for the purpose of determining the firm’s HUBZone eligibility. There is no “magic” or set number of factors that “makes” the worker an employee or an independent contractor. No one factor stands alone in making this determination. Factors which are relevant in one situation may not be relevant in another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IRS website has good resources to help you evaluate if the individual should be considered as an employee.&nbsp; Use the referenced hyperlinks at your convenience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here is an important rule of thumb:&nbsp; When in doubt as to whether to count an individual as an employee</p>\r\n\r\n<p>. . . Count that person toward the total employee count.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 10 Employee – Example 1</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s consider an example.&nbsp; Example 1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ABC, Inc. engages Betty Jones on a 1099 basis from March 2013 through August 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ms. Jones performed many duties: including contracts management; bid and proposal support; was responsible for coordinating task orders with ABC, Inc. customers, including understanding customer needs and developing the appropriate technical solution, and acting as a liaison with ABC customers to ensure the smooth delivery of products and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Betty did not have a signed consulting agreement with the ABC company and performed much of her responsibilities from home. She did not have any other clients and she logged her work hours into ABC’s payroll system.&nbsp; Further, among other things, Ms. Jones had an email address issued from ABC, Inc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 11 Is Betty and Employee? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>– Answer Example 1 Is Betty Jones an employee?&nbsp; The answer is yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering the totality of the circumstances, she would be considered an employee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 12 Employee – Example 2</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>ABC, Inc. engages Steve Smith on a 1099 basis to perform bookkeeping services. Mr. Smith has a signed contract with ABC that specifies the work to be performed, cost and delivery schedule for deliverables. He performs his work from his home in Providence, RI, has three other clients besides ABC, and at the end of each month, Mr. Smith issues his monthly invoice for the services performed to ABC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also has his own business cards and e-mail address.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 13 Is Steve an Employee? – Answer Example 2</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is Steve Smith an employee?&nbsp; The answer is no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering the totality of the circumstances, he would not be considered an employee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 14 Employee – Example 3</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>HUBZone Contractor A, Inc. has an employee named Sue Smith who gets paid only on a commission basis. How much she gets paid is tied to her monthly sales volume. Sue works about 160 hours per month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 15 Is Sue an Employee? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>– Answer Example 3 Is Sue Smith an employee?&nbsp; The answer is yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sue is considered an employee because she is expecting to receive compensation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 16 Principal Office Requirements</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topic Divide – Principal office requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 17 Principal Office – Defined</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok…. So, regarding the principal office, we know from earlier in this presentation that the principal office must be located in a designated HUBZone. However, and this is important, it must also be the location where the greatest number of the firm’s employees - at any one location - perform their work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When determining if a firm meets the principal office requirement, it must be clearly demonstrated that the largest number of employees – meeting the definition of an employee – perform their work at the location deemed as the principal office. In this accounting, employees who may come to the principal office to pick up their work orders but then they go to work in job sites, would not be counted as employees who work in the principal office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, and importantly, in determining where the greatest number of employees who work at any one location perform their work -- <em>the definition of the term employee</em>, -- as discussed previously, must be considered and appropriately applied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 18 More Clarity – Principal Office</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The firm’s headquarters does not have to be its “principal office”.&nbsp; This is an important distinction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A firm can have multiple locations that it leases or owns and still meet the principal office requirement if the office that is located in a HUBZone has the greatest number of its employees performing their work there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 19 Are PO Requirements Satisfied? – Example 1</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s consider our first example.&nbsp; Does Company B, Inc. meet the principal office requirement?&nbsp; Company B, Inc. is a small IT services company. It’s headquarters is located in an urban area that is not a designated HUBZone, according to the map. The two owners and an administrative support person spend the majority of their work hours at the headquarters location.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Across the street, in a qualified census tract, there is a government facility where 6 engineers, employed by Company B, perform contract specific work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, the owners and the administration team all live in a HUBZone a few miles away. Of the six employees at the government site, one of them is part time and works only 20 hours every week. Further, only one of the six employees who works at the government site lives in a HUBZone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 20 Company B – Answer Example 1</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Company B, Inc. does not meet the principal office requirement. This is why…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When evaluating the principal office requirement, where employees live, is not relevant. What matters is where the greatest number of employees - at any one location - perform their work. In this example, most of Company B’s employees work at the government site. The government site is considered a job site and as such the employees who work there cannot be counted towards the principal office calculation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, that leaves 3 employees who work in the firm’s only office, which is not in a HUBZone. Remember, when analyzing the principal office, the 35% rule is not applicable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 21 Are PO Requirements Met? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>– Example 2 Does XYZ, Inc. meet the principal office requirement?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The XYZ company executed a 6 month contract to obtain: management of mail, faxes and couriers; a receptionist to answer calls in the company name; and, 40 hours per month of complimentary use of a private office for one person. XYZ, Inc. has two employees, the owner and an administrative assistant. In addition, the owner works 160 hours per month from home, which is not in a HUBZone and the administrative assistant works 40 hours per month from the firm’s office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The XYZ company does not have any job sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 22 XYZ, Inc. - Answer Example 2</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The answer is no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>XYZ, Inc. has 2 offices, one in a HUBZone where the administrative assistant works and the other office is the owner’s home.&nbsp; As such there is no greater number of employees working at the HUBZone location. It is important to note, that the agreement for the office use was for 40 hours per month for one person.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, even if the owner was to decide to no longer work from home and move her work to the new office space, the agreement would need to be amended to properly reflect the increase of monthly hours and the number of people working from that location.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 23 35 Percent Rule</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>– HUBZone Residency Requirement Topic Divide - HUBZone residency requirement, the 35% rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 24 HUBZone Residency Requirement</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, so we have talked about employees and principal office requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, let’s take a closer look at the HUBZone residency requirement, that at least 35% of the firm’s employees must reside in a HUBZone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 25 HUBZone 35% Rule</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>–Example 1</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does Company J, Inc. meet the 35% requirement?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Company J is a small IT services company where: its headquarters is located in an urban area that is not a HUBZone; two owners and an administrative support person spend the majority of their work hours at headquarters; across the street, in a qualified census tract, is a government facility where 6 engineers perform contract specific work for the company; owners and the administration support person all live in a HUBZone a few miles away; six employees work at the government site - one of them is part time and works only 20 hours every week; and, only one of the six employees who works at the government site lives in a HUBZone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 26 – Answer HUBZone 35% Rule</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>– Example 1 Does Company J meet the 35% requirement? <strong>YES.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, when determining if a firm meets the 35% employee HUBZone residency requirement, where employees work – does not need be considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 27 Resources and Tools</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topic Divide – Resources and tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 28 Resources and Tools</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some very powerful resources and tools available to assist you to better understand the HUBZone program.&nbsp; Use these resources and others to learn, discover and expand your understanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 29 Contact Us…</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about HUBZone program.

HUBZone areas or HUBZone designations are typically areas of low median household incomes or high unemployment, or both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 3 Program Purpose</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>But first, and importantly, the HUBZone program has one purpose: to help small businesses in both urban and rural communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It provides federal contracting assistance to qualified small firms located in historically underutilized business zones -- or HUBZones -- to increase employment opportunities, stimulate capital investment in those areas, and empower communities through economic leveraging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 4 How the Program Works</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. Small Business Administration regulates and implements the HUBZone program. As such, SBA determines which businesses are eligible for the program, maintains a listing of qualified HUBZone small businesses that can be used by federal agencies to fulfill procurement needs and adjudicates protests of eligibility regarding HUBZone contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"////Users/billrollins/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image002.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 5 Contents</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"////Users/billrollins/Library/Group%20Containers/UBF8T346G9.Office/TemporaryItems/msohtmlclip/clip_image004.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 6 HUBZone Status Protests</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topic Divide -- HUBZone status protests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 7 What is a HUBZone Status Protest?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simply stated, a HUBZone status protest is a challenge to the award or proposed award of a contract to a company who allegedly misrepresented itself as a certified HUBZone firm, eligible for a specific contract award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>HUBZone status protests are one of the ways in which the government ensures that only qualified HUBZone companies gain access to HUBZone contracting preferences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 8 Under What Circumstances?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a company wins an award through any of these mechanisms, its HUBZone status may be protested: sole source awards; set-aside awards, including partial set-asides, to HUBZone firms; awards to&nbsp; HUBZone firms through full and open competition after a price evaluation preference is applied; awards based on a reserve for HUBZone firms in a solicitation for a Multiple Award Contract; or, orders set-aside for HUBZone firms against a Multiple Award Contract, which had been awarded in full and open competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to note, a protest alleging that a company is not small, is considered a size protest. Such protests are not processed by the HUBZone office. The process for submitting a size protest is outlined in <a href=\"http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp&amp;amp;SID=9096292d442b42246cbecf21f04833bd&amp;amp;r=PART&amp;amp;n=pt13.1.121\">13 CFR 121.1001.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 9 For What Reasons?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA will consider processing a HUBZone status protest if: the principal office of the protested firm is not located in a designated HUBZone; at least 35 percent of the employees of the protested firm do not reside in a designated HUBZone; the protested firm is not at least 51% unconditionally and directly owned and controlled by persons who are United States citizens; and, the protested firm is not a qualified HUBZone small business as described at 13 CFR 126.103 and 13 CFR 126.200.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, it is important to point out, a size protest is not processed by the HUBZone office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 10 Regulatory Guidance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regulatory guidance concerning HUBZone status protests can be found in 13 CFR Parts 126.800 through 126.805, in subpart “H” and in FAR Part 19.306.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 11 Filing a HUBZone Status Protest</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topic Divide – Filing a HUBZone status protest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 12 Who Can File a HUBZone Status Protest?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For sole source acquisitions, the SBA or the contracting officer may protest the apparently successful offeror’s HUBZone status. For all other acquisitions, the offeror who is an interested party, the contracting officer, or the SBA may protest the apparently successful offeror’s HUBZone status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 13 Where Should a Status Protest be Submitted?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An offeror must submit its protest to the contracting officer. The contracting officer and the SBA must submit protests to SBA’s Director for the HUBZone Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, all status protests must be in writing and must state all specific grounds for the protest. An assertion that a protested firm is not a qualified HUBZone small business without setting forth specific facts or allegations, is insufficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 14 How Should a HUBZone Status Protest be Submitted?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, HUBZone status protests must be in writing and submitted by e-mail, traditional mail, or in person. Such protests must also be submitted within five business days after the bid opening or notification of the intended award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For sealed bid acquisitions, an interested party must submit its protest by close of business on the fifth business day after bid opening, or if the price evaluation preference was not applied at the time of bid opening, by close of business on the fifth business day from the date of identification of the apparent successful offeror.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 15 Must be Sufficiently Sufficient</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to successfully file a protest and avoid having it dismissed by the SBA, it must be sufficiently specific and state all relevant facts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, a protest is not sufficient if it simply states that a firm is not in compliance because it has not recertified (every 3 years) and submitting as evidence, only a copy of the firm’s Dynamic Small Business Search profile, showing a HUBZone certification date that is more than three years old. The date given in DSBS indicates only the initial date of certification and does not reflect the date of any recertification process, which is internal to the SBA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In another example, it is sufficiently specific to state that a firm is not in compliance with the principal office requirement because the firm’s website lists numerous locations, and a photo is included showing that the stated principal office location is a boarded up building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A protest merely asserting that a company is not a qualified HUBZone concern will be dismissed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 16 SBA’s Role: Processing a HUBZone Status Protest</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topic Divide – SBA’s role: processing a HUBZone status protest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 17 Processing the Protest -- Notification</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, how does SBA process a HUBZone status protest?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, SBA will determine whether a specific protest is both timely and sufficiently specific. If it is, SBA will process it. If it is not, SBA will dismiss it. In some cases where SBA determines that a protest is not timely, it may protest the award itself based on the facts in the dismissed protest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, SBA will notify the contracting officer and the protestor of the date it received the protest and whether it will process it or dismiss it. SBA will also notify the protested HUBZone firm of the protest and the identity of the protestor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The firm being protested may submit information to SBA in response to or defending itself relative to the protest, within five business days. It is also important to note, SBA will determine the status of a protested company within 15 business days of receiving the protest, unless the contracting officer grants an extension.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 18 HUBZone Firm – Responding to a Protest</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If SBA decides to process a protest, the protested firm, as previously noted, has five business days to provide documentation showing that it was in compliance with HUBZone eligibility requirements at the time of the contract offer and award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, good record keeping is essential. A HUBZone firm should maintain records that document its HUBZone certification -- for at least 6 years -- from the date of its initial application and/or recertification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 19&nbsp; Additional Information and Fraud</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After reviewing the documents requested and received, SBA may have further requests for additional documents or clarification of information provided by the firm.&nbsp; Further, signed declarations bear</p>\r\n\r\n<p>greater weight than mere statements. In addition, the SBA’s regulations explain the penalties that may be imposed when a person or business concern provides false information to the federal government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA will submit suspected cases of fraud to the Office of Inspector General.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 20 When SBA Makes a Protest Decision</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What happens when SBA makes a HUBZone protest decision?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When SBA makes a decision, it notifies the contracting officer, protestor, and the protested concern of its determination. If the company is found to be compliant, SBA denies the protest, and the company may be awarded the contract in question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the company is found to be ineligible at either time of the offer and/or award, SBA sustains the protest and the company, may be decertified immediately; cannot be awarded the contract in question; and, may only apply for new HUBZone certification after 90 days from the date of decertification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A protest decision may be dismissed by the SBA because it was untimely, not submitted by an interested party, or not specific enough. In some such cases, SBA may file its own protest, if the information was specific.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA’s protest decisions are posted on its website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 21 Appealing a Protest Decision</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topic Divide – Appealing a protest decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 22 How Are Appeals Filed?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes SBA’s status protest decisions are questioned. In such circumstances, SBA may consider an appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only the protested HUBZone firm, the protestor, or the contracting officer may submit an appeal to the SBA. The appeal must be in writing and submitted by mail, or in person.&nbsp; It must also be submitted to the SBA within five business days after receiving the notice of the protest decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, the individual or firm filing the protest must notify all parties eligible or potentially impacted by the appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 23 Contents of an Appeal</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What should be included in an appeal request?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The appeal must be clear and fact-worthy. It should include specific information explaining why SBA’s initial protest decision resulted in a significant error or failed to consider important facts that were contained in the information supplied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, SBA will not consider additional information or changed circumstances that were not disclosed at the time of its initial decision or that are based on a disagreement with the findings and conclusions contained in the determination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 24 SBA’s Appeal Decision is Final</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once an appeal is received, SBA will make a decision within five business days of receipt of the appeal, if practicable. The agency will provide a copy of the appeal decision to the contracting officer, protestor, and the protested HUBZone company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the protest decision is overturned by appeal, the consequences are the same as if the initial decision was made in that way. That is, if a sustained protest is overturned on appeal, the protested company is now eligible to receive the contract in question. Conversely, if a denied protest is overturned, the protested company is immediately decertified and will not receive the contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, once a protest decision is rendered by the agency, that is SBA’s final decision. In some very rare cases, involving unique circumstances, a decision may be reconsidered by the SBA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 25 Resources and Tools</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topic Divide – Resources and tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 26 – Resources and Tools</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some very powerful resources and tools available to assist you to better understand the HUBZone program.&nbsp; Use these resources and others to learn, discover and expand your understanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 27 Contact Us…</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about HUBZone program.

It includes multiple sections covering a variety of topics that define and explain proposal preparation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The course is about building an amazing story that touches all components of a contract proposal – such that a compelling case is made for a firm -- your firm -- to be the best solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, the material is also indexed so you can easily go forward or back to any section at any time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 3 Course Contents</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Key topics in this training include: instructions on building a foundation; an overview of the types of solicitations and Standard Forms used by the government; a frank discussion about how to write a proposal; costs and pricing guidelines; the benefits of learning from others; a menu of helpful resources; and finally, a push to apply what you have learned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 4 Learning Objectives</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Understand the types of solicitations and contracts used by the federal government</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn how to respond appropriately to government solicitations with proposals that enhance your chances of winning a contract</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The objectives for this course are simple and two-fold: (1) to help small businesses understand the types of solicitations and contracts used by the federal government and, (2) to learn how to respond appropriately to government solicitations with proposals that win contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 5 Expectations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Many companies aspire to do contractual work for the federal government, most will not…</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Many reasons – some firms are not qualified, some are not competitive, some will just talk about it, and others just don’t understand (or are intimidated by) the proposal process</li>\r\n\t<li>Best preparation is learning about and understanding the process, aligning skills with needs and following-through</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But first, a statement about expectations. Many companies aspire to do contractual work for the federal government.&nbsp; The reality however, is most will not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many reasons for this. Some firms are not qualified, some are not competitive, some will just talk about it, and others, well they just don’t understand how to prepare proposals that get attention and win contracts. It is also true that sometimes the government doesn’t buy the types of goods and services you sell, or in quantities that make it feasible for you to bid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Expectations don’t always match reality. The best preparation for winning government contracts is understanding the process, aligning skills with needs and following-through. In other words, prepare, align and execute – that will help you beat the odds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 6 Building the Foundation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 1. Building the foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 7 Building the Foundation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Define what you do</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Register in the System for Award Management (SAM), including the Dynamic Small Business Search (DSBS)</li>\r\n\t<li>Develop a compelling small business profile and capability statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Find contract opportunities Narrative</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The first step in proposal preparation is building a solid foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A foundation that includes defining what you do in government terms, registering in SAM, the government database of potential and existing federal contractors, developing a compelling small business profile and capability statement, including a Dynamic Small Business Search profile and finally, finding contract opportunities that are suitable for you to bid on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is all preliminary before preparing a contract proposal for the government….</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are new to the government contracting space, consider reviewing the 3-part GC 101 training series. This series will provide you with an understanding of contract basics. You really do need to understand the basics, before you can appreciate how to prepare a contract proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 8 Define Your Products and Services</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Government/firms use the <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/\">North American Industry Classification System </a>(NAICS) to identify products and services</li>\r\n\t<li>DOD uses <a href=\"http://www.dlis.dla.mil/hcfsch21.asp\">Federal Supply Group and Class </a>(FSG/FSC)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://fedgov.dnb.com/webform\">D-U-N-S numbers </a>are used to identify prospective vendors</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code used to identify a contractor’s facility at a specific location</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The government is a unique buyer. Federal agencies use the North American Industry Classification System, more commonly referred to as a NAICS code, to identify products and services by industry type. The NAICS code is a six digit number that describes or defines a particular product or service a company supplies.&nbsp; A firm will generally have a primary NAICS code, but can have multiple NAICS codes as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can find and define the NAICS codes for your products and services by using the referenced hyperlink. It is also important to note that you can use your NAICS code or codes to conduct online searches at the websites of numerous federal agencies to learn what they are buying. A NAICS code, or codes, identifies the products and services your company supplies. It does not uniquely identify your business. The Federal government uses D-U-N-S numbers, provided by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, to identify prospective vendors.&nbsp; You can obtain a D-U-N-S number at no cost to you by clicking on the hyperlink.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To participate in contract opportunities within the Department of Defense, a firm will also need to know its Federal Supply Group or Class code. In addition, the Commercial and Government Entity or (CAGE) Code is a five-character ID number used extensively within the federal government. The CAGE code is used to support a variety of mechanized systems throughout the government and provides a standardized method of identifying a given facility at a specific location.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 9 Register in SAM</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The System for Award Management (SAM) is the primary source for agencies to learn about prospective vendors</li>\r\n\t<li>Government maintained database</li>\r\n\t<li>A firm must register in <a href=\"http://www.sam.gov/\">SAM </a>to participate as a seller in the Federal space</li>\r\n\t<li>Small firms should also maintain an updated Dynamic Small Business Search (DSBS) profile as part of SAM</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The System for Award Management, more commonly known as SAM, is the primary source for agencies to learn about prospective vendors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SAM is a government-maintained free database of companies wanting to do business with the government. This database is a marketing tool for businesses and a searchable list of prospective vendors for the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A firm must register in the SAM system to participate as a seller in the federal space. Further, a firm’s profile in SAM must be updated at least once every 12 months – for the profile to stay active.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Completing an accurate and appealing small business profile in the government’s SAM system is an important, foundational step in marketing goods and services to the federal government. As such, you should learn as much as possible about the SAM system. That includes accessing the SAM site and performing multiple searches, as if you were looking to hire a firm similar to your own business. Review profiles of businesses in similar areas of expertise and use them as guides when developing your own business profile.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, treat your SAM and Dynamic Small Business Profile as your business resume. And, as with any resume, it should be regularly reviewed, updated and strengthened. Importantly, spelling and grammar do matter as they reflect your attention to detail and can form a contracting officer’s first impression of your firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 10 Develop a Compelling Capability Statement</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Prepare a comprehensive <em>Capability Statement </em>outlining management, technical and business strengths – can help in developing a “line card “ or brochure</li>\r\n\t<li>Statement should include:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Specific capabilities and skills</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Past performance history, with specific projects and value of contracts</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Awards and commendations</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Resumes of key management</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Seek feedback and refine accordingly</li>\r\n\t<li>Will serve as an important foundational element in the preparation of proposals that respond to government solicitations</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A business should prepare and maintain a comprehensive-yet concise-capability statement that clearly outlines its management, technical and business strengths.&nbsp; This too is important!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such a statement should include specific capabilities and skills, past performance history, awards and commendations, and resumes of key management personnel. A contracting officer’s time is limited and valuable. A simple one page capability statement is more likely to be viewed, while a 5-10 page document may be tossed on a pile. There’s time later on for a more detailed description of your firm’s capabilities. Initially, you just want to pique their interest in you. In addition, you can use a well developed capability statement to create a “line card” or brochure that you can use for marketing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with your SAM profile, you should seek regular feedback on your capability statement and refine and update it accordingly. Your capability statement will likely serve as a foundational element in preparing proposals in response to government solicitations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 11 Seek Contract Opportunities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Find prime contract opportunities</li>\r\n\t<li>Find Subcontract opportunities</li>\r\n\t<li>Market directly to agencies</li>\r\n\t<li>Subscribe to bid-matching services</li>\r\n\t<li>Use procurement vehicles Narrative</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A key part of building a solid foundation is seeking contract opportunities that make sense or that justify spending the time and resources to prepare contract proposals. This is an important aspect of proposal</p>\r\n\r\n<p>preparation. A business can waste a lot of time and money responding to solicitations that do not make sense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 12 Find Contract Opportunities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Federal government lists contract opportunities online at <a href=\"http://www.fbo.gov/\">www.fbo.gov</a></li>\r\n\t<li>Learn more about FBO: <a href=\"https://www.fbo.gov/?static=vids&amp;amp;s=getstart&amp;amp;mode=list&amp;amp;tab=list&amp;amp;tabmode=list\">User Guides,</a> <a href=\"https://www.fbo.gov/?static=vids&amp;amp;s=getstart&amp;amp;mode=list&amp;amp;tab=list&amp;amp;tabmode=list\">Training Videos </a>&amp; <a href=\"https://www.fbo.gov/?static=faqs&amp;amp;s=getstart&amp;amp;mode=list&amp;amp;tab=list&amp;amp;tabmode=list\">FAQs</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knowing how to find contract opportunities is critical. A key resource is the government’s website, Federal Business Opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To outreach contract opportunities to the public, the federal government operates a robust, online service called Federal Business Opportunities, but more commonly known as FBO or FedBizOpps. This single entry, government-wide website profiles available business opportunities and is one of the most powerful tools available to help a firm become successful in government contracting. The online tool identifies contract opportunities over $25,000.00.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firms can also view past awarded contracts in the FBO – which may help you with preparing future proposals or bids.&nbsp; This is important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slide 13 Find Subcontract Opportunities</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Subcontracting can be profitable</li>\r\n\t<li>Performing as a subcontractor can prepare you to be a prime contractor in the future</li>\r\n\t<li>SBA maintains a database of subcontracting opportunities. This searchable database is called <a href=\"http://web.sba.gov/subnet/search/index.cfm?CFID=3326268&amp;amp;CFTOKEN=dd547388634a6447-D5095AFE-E879-6168-A5D8DD639D02C393\">SUB-Net</a></li>\r\n\t<li>SBA also profiles on its website the <a href=\"http://www.sba.gov/subcontracting-directory\">Subcontracting Opportunities Directory </a>by state</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An alternative to seeking prime contracts is to explore subcontracting opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subcontracting with a prime contractor can be a profitable experience as well as a growth opportunity for a business. To help small businesses find opportunities, SBA maintains, SUB-Net, a searchable database of available subcontract opportunities. The SBA also displays on its website the Subcontracting Opportunities Directory by state.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At your convenience, return to this slide and use the links to explore subcontracting opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 14 Use Procurement Vehicles</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Consolidated purchasing vehicles</li>\r\n\t<li>Multiple Award Schedules</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn about <a href=\"http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/197989\">GSA Schedules</a></li>\r\n\t<li>Learn about <a href=\"http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104874\">GWACS</a></li>\r\n\t<li>Some agencies offer agency-wide contract vehicles</li>\r\n\t<li>Some Multiple Award Schedules maybe reserved specifically for small firms Narrative</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The Federal government tries to benefit from economies of scale and make it easier for vendors to sell to the government by establishing Multiple Award Schedules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These schedules are often referred to as procurement vehicles.&nbsp; Two examples of this type of contracting include General Services Administration (GSA) Schedules and Government Wide Acquisition Contracts or (GWACs). Under the GSA Schedule, GSA negotiates prices and terms with prospective vendors and enters into an agreement with those vendors. Under the agreement, participating government agencies can purchase products and services from a schedule of prospective vendors, according to prices and terms already agreed to by the vendors. It is also important to note that some agencies offer agency-wide contract vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Procurement vehicles can be valuable tools for small businesses to gain access to contract opportunities. Importantly, some multiple award schedules are exclusively set-aside for small firms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 15 Subscribe to Bid-Matching Services</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Some companies subscribe to bid-matching services</li>\r\n\t<li>Provide contract leads that match a client’s qualifications</li>\r\n\t<li>Procurement Technical Assistance Centers (PTACs) offer free bid-matching services -- find your <a href=\"http://www.dla.mil/SmallBusiness/Pages/ptac.aspx\">local PTAC</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some companies subscribe to bid-matching services. Such services provide leads on prospective contract opportunities that match a business’s qualifications. These services can do much of the work associated with finding contract opportunities, but the business still has to prepare the bid or proposal and win the contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also important to note that the FBO has a service which can alert you to bid opportunities. PTACs also offer free bid matching services. PTACs, funded by the Department of Defense, can be excellent overall procurement resource.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 16 Types of Solicitations Narrative</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 2. Types of solicitations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 17 Types of Solicitations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Government contracting is big business</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Bid package is usually a set of documents to which a bidder would develop a responsive proposal</li>\r\n\t<li>Solicitations used by the government typically come in three formats</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Request for Quote (RFQ)</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Request for Proposal (RFP)</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Invitation for Bid (IFB)</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Sources Sought (RFI)</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Government contracting is big business with thousands of contracts -- in hundreds of billions of dollars -- being executed by the federal government each year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bid packages used by the government usually contain a set of documents to which a bidder&nbsp; develops a responsive proposal. Such solicitations typically come in four primary formats or types: Request for Quote (RFQ); Request for Proposal (RFP); Invitation for Bid (IFB); and, Source Sought – Request for Information (RFI). Each of these solicitation types, as well as some of the key forms required by the government are discussed in the following slides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 18 Solicitation Numbers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Solicitation numbers are important to understand…….</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SBA123-14-R-0000</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To better understand the types of solicitations, let’s first look at the government’s numbering system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each solicitation issued by the government is assigned a number. The number tells much about the solicitation. The first six digits identify the buying facility. The second two digits indicate the fiscal year the contract was issued in. The alpha character defines the type of solicitation – which is both revealing and important. The R character – shown here -- indicates a request for proposal.

This format is described in the noted FAR references and contains four parts and multiple sections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part I contains section A, which includes the use of Standard Form 33, Standard Form 26 or Standard Form 1447. In some circumstances it may also include Standard Form 18 – which is a Request for Quotations. Sections B – H include a list of supplies and services to be acquired, the statement of work, packaging requirements, inspection and acceptance specifics, delivery and performance requirements, and any special provisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some of the provisions may only be incorporated by reference. However, you should go to the FAR to read those provisions to avoid any unpleasant surprises later on.

However, Section C in Part I and Section L in Part IV are particularly important and should be cross-referenced when reviewing the solicitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also important to note ----- contract solicitations for bids estimated to be below the simplified acquisition threshold or $150,000 will use a streamlined contract format and may or may not use some of the parts and sections outlined in the uniform contract format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 26 Standard Forms Narrative</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 3.

Importantly, an RFQ may also be used for quotation requests that have an estimated value above $150,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Standard Form 26 is sometimes used to award a contract resulting from the use of Standard Form 18.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 32 Standard Form 26</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Standard Form 26, Award/Contract is the form used by the federal government to award a contract, usually as a result of a <em>Request for Quotation</em></li>\r\n\t<li>Similar to SF 33, although it requires additional certification information Narrative</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Standard Form 26, Award/Contract is the form used by the federal government to award a contract, usually as a result of a <em>Request for Quotation</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, this form is similar to Standard Form 33, although it requires additional certification information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 33 How to Write the Proposal Narrative</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 4. How to write the proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 34 How to (actually) Write the Proposal</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Do your homework --- carefully read and reread the solicitation document to clearly understand what is being asked, including clauses and provisions</li>\r\n\t<li>If you are not sure about something --- ask questions</li>\r\n\t<li>Respond appropriately</li>\r\n\t<li>Align your proposal with the government’s needs</li>\r\n\t<li>Articulate what makes you the best solution provider Narrative</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Just thinking about responding to a government RFP or solicitation can be stressful. Writing the proposal, well that can make you even more anxious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It doesn’t have to be that way. Preparing a response to a government procurement request or invitation is an important task, not necessarily a daunting one. It should be approached with diligence and professionalism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Writing a successful proposal is about doing your homework, preparing and responding clearly and appropriately, aligning your proposal with the government’s needs and articulating what makes you the best solution provider.&nbsp; These elements are critical to successful proposal writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 35 Carefully Review the Solicitation and Rules</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Preparation is key – you must be prepared…</li>\r\n\t<li>Carefully review the solicitation, including all applicable schedules, clauses, and attachments</li>\r\n\t<li>Review and understand the regulations (<strong>FAR Parts</strong>) governing the specific type of solicitation you plan to respond to</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative Preparation is key…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are going to respond to a government RFP or other type of procurement request, you must be prepared, or you will likely just be wasting your time. The reality is, if you do not comply with all requirements in the solicitation, your proposal may be deemed “non-responsive.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carefully read the solicitation, including all applicable schedules, clauses and attachments. This is important. The solicitation is designed to provide prospective bidders with all of the information needed to write a successful proposal. The agency that prepared the solicitation expects you to read and follow it carefully.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, make sure you review and understand the regulations (FAR Parts) governing the specific type of solicitation you plan to respond to.&nbsp; Some of the regulatory references relevant to a solicitation and the proposal process are highlighted in this slide. If possible, assemble a team to review and prepare the proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep in mind, these are only some references. Other regulatory or policy guidance may be applicable to the specific procurement you are considering. Talk with a contracting officer, PTAC or other counselor for more assistance. Some PTACs and SBDCs offer training on how to prepare and submit proposals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider taking such training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 36 Prepare and Respond Appropriately</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Responding appropriately follows from reading and understanding the government’s request</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Answer all questions, provide all information and follow all schedules in the order, time-frame and structure requested</li>\r\n\t<li>Business that does not comply with all requirements, may be determined to be non-responsive</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>This is important Narrative</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Responding appropriately to a solicitation follows from reading and understanding the government’s request. Solicitations are usually very specific and follow a uniform contract format. It is important that you respond, as you are asked – answering all questions, providing all information and following all schedules in the order, time-frame and structure requested. Eliminate any guesswork by ensuring that each response is appropriately identified so the reviewer can readily recognize the section of the RFP which is being addressed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a small business does not comply with all of the requirements in a solicitation, it may be determined to be non-responsive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This may sound like common sense and it is. But, you would be surprised to learn how many proposals submitted to the government that are received after the due-date and that do not respond to what was asked for, or requested.&nbsp; Responding appropriately is important!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 37 Align Proposal with the Government’s Needs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Good proposal will clearly articulate how the bidder can solve the problem or fill the need outlined by the government</li>\r\n\t<li>Understanding the government’s request is important -- how your firm can execute or deliver an appropriate solution is critical</li>\r\n\t<li>A proposal may look good, but if it is not clearly aligned with fulfilling the government’s needs, it will fall behind other more substantive, solution focused proposals</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good proposal will clearly articulate how the bidder can solve the problem or fill the need outlined in the government’s solicitation. This again, follows from understanding the nature of the procurement request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding the government’s needs is important. Even more important, however is how your firm plans to execute or deliver an appropriate solution. It is, after all about convincing a government review panel that your proposal solves a specific problem or need and is the best fit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A proposal may look good and read well, but if it is not clearly aligned with fulfilling the government’s needs, it will likely fall behind other more substantive, solution focused proposals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don’t get caught up in telling a great story about your company, focusing too much on “we can do the work.” What really matters is substantiating how you can do the specific work that is needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 38 Articulate What Makes You the Best Solution</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Key is pulling it all together in a proposal package that clearly describes why your company offers the best solution</li>\r\n\t<li>No magic bullet – it comes down to doing a lot of things right</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It’s about:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Understanding the solicitation and responding appropriately</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Demonstrating how your firm can best fulfill the government’s needs</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Offering pricing that is fair and competitive</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Making sure your proposal is well-written and error free</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Showing evidence of success through past performance</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Interweaving an amazing story throughout all parts of the proposal that makes a compelling case for your firm as the best solution</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A typical government solicitation requires the bidder to provide a great deal of information. The key is pulling it all together in a proposal package that clearly describes why your company offers the best solution and is the best fit to perform the work. Think capture management……. There is no magic bullet.&nbsp; It comes down to doing a lot of things right.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s about: understanding the solicitation and responding appropriately; clearly demonstrating how your firm can best fulfill the government’s need; offering pricing that is fair and competitive; making sure your proposal is well-written and error free; showing evidence of success through past performance;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>and finally, interweaving an amazing story throughout all parts of the proposal, including the executive summary – that makes a compelling case for your firm as the best solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also highly recommended that you have reviewers outside of the proposal writers to review the draft and final product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 39 What to Avoid…</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Failure to fully understand the solicitation and governing regulations</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Incomplete or late submission</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Proposal is not specific and to the point</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>High on fluff and weak on substance</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Failure to understand best value considerations</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Unrealistic proposal pricing</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Evaluation components are not sufficiently addressed in the proposal</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Errors in the submission Narrative</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes learning from the mistakes of others provides the best lessons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With regards to solid proposal preparation, some key things to avoid include: not fully understanding the solicitation and governing regulations; submitting an incomplete or late submission; not providing specificity or focus; highlighting too much fluff and not enough substance, not understanding best value considerations; unrealistic pricing; failure to address evaluation factors; and errors in the submission.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you aren’t selected for a contract, consider asking for a debriefing to learn where you may have gone wrong and what you can do to improve your future proposals. Done in a professional manner, this can be a way to show contracting staff of your willingness to improve and to be more responsive to the government’s needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 40 Costs and Pricing Narrative</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 5. Costs and pricing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 41 Introduction to Contract Pricing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Contract pricing is an important aspect of procurement and an important component in developing a strategy to win federal contracts</li>\r\n\t<li>COs are responsible for ensuring that agencies purchase supplies and services from responsible sources at fair and reasonable prices</li>\r\n\t<li>Firm is responsible for developing a contract pricing strategy that is reasonable, competitive, but profitable</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contract pricing is an important aspect of procurement and a particularly important component in developing a strategy to win federal contracts.&nbsp; There are two sides to this issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, the government’s perspective. Federal contracting officers are responsible for ensuring that government agencies purchase supplies and services from responsible sources at fair and reasonable prices. As such and to accomplish this, most contracting officers and agency buyers conduct considerable market research to better understand markets and pricing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A contractor will likely have a related, but different perspective.&nbsp; A small firm wanting to do business with the government is responsible for developing a contract pricing strategy that is reasonable, competitive, but profitable. The typical contract bidder wants to make as much as possible in profit, but at the same time be competitive and win the bid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As such, with contracting officers doing considerable market research and a high number of firms competing for federal contracts, pricing is an important variable. A variable that can make or break your success in federal contract markets.&nbsp; A business must be aware of historical and current pricing trends, be thoughtful in its pricing analysis, competitive and able to make a profit --- if it wants to succeed in the federal contract space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 42 Negotiated Contracts vs. Sealed Bid Contracts</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Two key types of contracts</li>\r\n\t<li>Any contract awarded using other than sealed bidding procedures is considered a negotiated contract</li>\r\n\t<li>Procedures for contracting by negotiation permit negotiations prior to contract award, but may or may not include negotiated discussions</li>\r\n\t<li>Pricing a proposal will likely be influenced by your ability to negotiate or not negotiate Narrative</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>As discussed in the earlier section, proposal preparation, there are two fundamental contract categories: negotiated contracts and sealed bid contracts. The distinction between the two is important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FAR states that any contract awarded using other than sealed bidding procedures is considered a negotiated contract.&nbsp; Procedures for contracting by sealed bidding require the government to evaluate</p>\r\n\r\n<p>bids without discussions and award to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the invitation for bids, will be most advantageous to the government considering only price and price related factors. Negotiations are not permitted prior to the contract award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Procedures for contracting by negotiation permit negotiations prior to contract award. However, a solicitation under procedures for contracting by negotiation may or may not actually include negotiations. For example, the instructions to offerors may include the provision, the “Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions.\" When that provision is used, actual negotiations are not permitted unless the contracting officer determines in writing that they are necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also and importantly, a contracting officer may request a “Best and Final Offer,” but doesn’t have to, so be sure your proposal is responsive, accurate, complete and your pricing is fair and reasonable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 43 Regulatory Guidance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>FAR Part 15 – Negotiated Contracts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>15.101 Best value continuum</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>15.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contract pricing</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>15403 Obtaining cost or pricing data</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>15.405 Price negotiation</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>15.407 Special cost or pricing data</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>FAR Part 14 – Sealed Bid Contracts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>14.201-8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Price related factors</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>14.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Submission of bids</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>–&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14.408 &nbsp;Award</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>14.408-2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Responsible bidder – Reasonableness of price</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>FAR Part 13 – Simplified Acquisition Procedures</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How you analyze your costs and price your proposal is primarily up to you, as long as you follow applicable government rules and guidelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal rules for negotiated and sealed bid contracts and contracts that follow simplified acquisition procedures are outlined in FAR parts, 15, 14 and 13, respectively. Also, highlighted in the slide are FAR subparts that are pricing related.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>20</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to note, in addition to FAR guidance, other agency pricing guidelines or policies may also apply for specific contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 44 Pricing Approach</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Product Pricing </strong>(typical formula)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Material Costs + Labor Costs + Overhead Expenses + Profit</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Service Pricing </strong>(typical formula)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Hourly Overhead Expense + Hourly Wage + Profit</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pricing approach used by bidders for products and services being procured, besides following specific contract rules, is pretty typical, but unique to the business doing the pricing. That is, individual business costs and other considerations are factored into pricing formulas that are typical or generally used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, with regards to product pricing, a firm would typically consider and add material costs, plus labor costs, plus estimated overhead expenses, plus a profit margin to arrive at a price it would propose or charge for the product being delivered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding the pricing of a service, a firm would typically consider and add estimated hourly overhead expenses, plus hourly wages, plus a profit margin to arrive at a price it would propose or charge. This type of pricing will require becoming aware of Department of Labor wage rate agreements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to point out, that some government solicitations and contracts are very unique regarding costs and pricing and specific cost and pricing requirements may apply. Carefully review all government requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 45 Best Value / Lowest Price Technically Acceptable</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Best value procurement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>process used to select the most advantageous offer by evaluating and comparing factors in addition to cost or price</li>\r\n\t\t<li>allows the contracting officer flexibility in selecting the contractor who will give the government the best value for its money</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Lowest price technically acceptable procurement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>process that is appropriate when best value is expected to result from the selection of a technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also important to highlight the difference between “best value” procurements and lowest price, technically acceptable procurements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“Best Value” is a process used to select the most advantageous offer by evaluating and comparing factors in addition to cost or price. It allows the contracting officer flexibility in selection through tradeoffs which the agency makes between the cost and non-cost evaluation factors with the intent of making an award to the contractor -- who will give the government the best value for its money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding lowest price technically acceptable, this is a procurement process that is appropriate when best value is expected to result from the selection of a technically acceptable proposal with the lowest evaluated price. In other word, the contract award will be made on the basis of the lowest evaluated price of proposals meeting or exceeding the acceptability standards for non-cost factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 46 Important Pricing Considerations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Learn from past contracts -- review pricing history</li>\r\n\t<li>Consider all costs -- even special requirements</li>\r\n\t<li>Factor best value considerations</li>\r\n\t<li>Include bidding costs</li>\r\n\t<li>Allow for overhead and profit Narrative</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Contract pricing is a critical component in developing a strategy to win federal contracts. A successful pricing strategy will: learn from past contracts; consider all costs -- even special requirements; factor best value considerations; include bidding costs; and, importantly allow for sufficient overhead expenses and profit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a solicitation is using a ‘best value’ approach, the contracting officer may not make an award to the offeror providing the lowest price, rather an award will be made to that offeror who is providing the government with an approach that best meets the government’s needs. While price is always a consideration, in a best value scenario it doesn’t have to be the primary consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 47 Relationships and the Wisdom of Others Narrative</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 6.

It is a practical program with real-world examples and helpful tips. The course is directed to small business owners who are interested in borrowing money ---- to start, grow or expand their businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will find the course easy to follow and the subject matter indexed for quick reference and easy access. It will take about 30 minutes to complete. Additional time will be needed to review included resource materials and to complete the suggested next steps at the end of the course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The highlighted “next steps” at the conclusion of the program are an integral component of the course. They will help you apply what you have learned and engage you in the process of borrowing money..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you complete the course, you will have the option of receiving a printed Certificate of Completion from the SBA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 3 Course Objectives</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This course has three key objectives:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One, describe how to prepare a loan package for a lender. Two, explain how a lender will evaluate your loan request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And three, provide access to resources that can assist you in preparing a loan package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 4 Course Outline</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are eight topic sections within the course. Each section covers a different aspect of loan packaging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The course leads with “full disclosure” – that is, candid facts about borrowing money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It then describes what a lender will need to know about your loan request and how to comply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also covers in some detail, the components of a typical loan package and how to put the materials together in a meaningful way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 5 Course Outline (cont)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Practical packaging tips are also provided to help prepare you before speaking with a lender. In addition, the training provides an overview of how your loan request will be reviewed. Care is taken to help you understand how a lender will evaluate your request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also provides several “next steps” to start you in the process of preparing a loan package for a lender.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, numerous additional resources are identified to assist you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will notice a button in the top right section of each slide that says Course Outline. Clicking on that button will bring you to the course outline – which will give you quick access to any section of the course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OK, let’s get started. To advance to the next section, click on the continuation button on the bottom of your screen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 6 Full Disclosure</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the spirit of full disclosure, several important issues need to be addressed upfront.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>First. </strong>There is no such thing as 100% financing. You will be required to put money into the business, before a lender will provide financing. In some cases, some lenders will recognize “sweat equity” as a contribution to owner’s capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Second. </strong>Your credit history is important! If there are any credit issues that can be remedied, before meeting with a lender, do so. A lender may be able to make exceptions if you can document that a negative credit report was due to circumstances beyond your control. If this applies, include a detailed written explanation with supporting information in your loan package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Third. </strong>A lender will probably ask for a personal guaranty, even if you are incorporated. It is unlikely this can be avoided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fourth. </strong>There is no such thing as a government grant for individual small businesses. Contrary to what some unscrupulous sales pitches will suggest, there are no government sources, including the SBA, that provide free money for opening or growing a for-profit small business. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>And lastly, </strong>SBA does not lend money directly to small businesses, for any purpose, other than disaster assistance. Rather, SBA is a guarantor. It guarantees loans made by lenders to small firms. SBA provides a level of security to lenders, so they will provide financing to small businesses who might otherwise not be able to obtain financing from a lender.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 7 So You Think You Need A Loan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting a business loan is an age-old problem. Most entrepreneurs find it to be one of the greatest struggles they face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While the process can be time consuming and even frustrating, your chances of being successful are greatly increased, if you are informed and well prepared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being informed.., means doing your homework and understanding the borrowing process. ---- Being prepared.., means putting together a meaningful loan package that addresses the most common questions a lender will ask.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Questions such as: - What is the specific purpose of the loan? - How much of a loan are you requesting?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- When and how long will you need the funds? - How will the loan will be repaid? - What collateral can be used to secure the loan? - and, Will you provide a personal guaranty?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Answers to these questions, as well as supporting documentation are essential to the lending decision and will shape your lender’s response. Let’s look at each of these items.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 8 Loan Purpose</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly defining the purpose of a loan request is critical. A lender will review your financial requirements based primarily on two types of capital infusions, working capital and growth capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>•Working capital is used to meet fluctuating needs that will be repaid during the company's next full operating cycle, generally one year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>•Growth capital is used to meet needs that will be repaid with profits over a select period of time - usually not more than seven years, although some SBA financing options may provide a longer loan maturity. If seeking growth capital, you will be expected to show how the money will be used to increase profits sufficiently to repay the loan in the agreed-upon time frame.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 9 Loan Amount</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How much of a loan do you need to support specific business needs? This is the question you should address, NOT, how much can I borrow?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clearly defined business needs should be tightly aligned with the amount of financing you are requesting. How accurately and convincingly you speak to this --- will often determine your lender’s interest in your request and set the tone for further dialog.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, 100% financing is not an option….. And, never ask to borrow money you don’t need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 10 Loan Maturity &amp; Terms</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lender will want to know how long you need the borrowed funds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reality, however, for working capital or asset-based loans is that the loan maturity will be tied to the amount of time needed to satisfy specific cash flow issues or the life expectancy of the asset being purchased.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, working capital loans or lines of credit would have short-term maturities, typically under one year. An asset-based or equipment loan, perhaps to purchase a business vehicle or machinery, could have a maturity tied to the lifecycle of the asset. This type of loan, typically would have a maturity of three to seven years. The key exception would be SBA guaranteed loans. Such loans could have maturities greater than ten years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 11 Repayment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loan repayment is a <strong>big deal </strong>to a lender. You should give serious and careful consideration to how your business will repay a requested loan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lender will examine past and projected financial statements to determine if your company can and will generate sufficient cash flow to service new debt, with on time payments. Remember, the lender will be looking for documented evidence and assurance that a given loan can and will be paid on-time and in full.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lender’s concerns are no different than your-own. If you were going to lend money to a friend or acquaintance, you would want assurances that the debt will be satisfied --- as agreed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 12 Collateral</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Collateral is another major piece of the financing pie. Lenders find comfort in using collateral to secure a loan. Remember, its all about lowering risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question will be asked ----- so you might as well prepare yourself. What collateral do you have, or will you acquire with loan proceeds, that is available to secure your loan request? Examples of collateral include: real estate, inventory, savings, stock, equipment and motor vehicles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, a lender may secure a working capital loan with inventory and accounts receivable. In another example, a lender may secure an asset loan with the asset or equipment being acquired. In both cases, the lender would probably ask for a personal guarantee as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lenders can be very creative in using collateral to secure a loan. Consider all of your options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To prepare yourself, identify available collateral, estimate its value and be prepare to provide supporting documentation to justify its worth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 13 Personal Guaranty</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is almost a certainty that you will be asked to provide a personal guaranty, if you borrow money for a small business. It matters NOT, that your business may be incorporated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we said earlier, its all about lowering risk. A personal guarantee means that you are willing to pledge your personal assets to protect the lender, in a situation where you are unable to re-pay the loan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 14 Components of a Loan Package</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>OK… Let’s now consider what a loan request package should look like. It is important to point out…, loan packaging is not an exact science. In fact, loan packaging means different things to different people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good package will tell a compelling story and answer most, if not all questions, a lender may have about your business and loan request. It will provide enough information and documentation so that your loan request is clearly understood and that your lender could discuss and defend it before a loan committee. There are three major components of a loan package, with some components containing multiple parts. Again, this is not an exact science and different lenders require different things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, for our discussion and general purposes, we will focus on the following components: statement of purpose, business plan and financial statements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 15 Statement of Purpose</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The statement of purpose is a critical component of the loan package and is sometimes developed within a letter to a specific lender or is otherwise labeled the “executive summary” and is attached to the business plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How it is done is up to you….. What’s important is that it be well written and informative, as it’s likely to be the first thing the lender reviews.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It should include information about the request in terms of amount, purpose, duration, repayment and available collateral. It also should include a brief description about the business and include a crisp narrative outlining the positive effects the loan will have on the business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, this statement of purpose should include one or several paragraphs describing the amount of capital invested by the owners.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 16 Business Plan or Plan Excerpts</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having a comprehensive, well-thought-out business plan is essential to the financing process. You need a business plan before a lender will provide a loan. In fact, without one, even approaching a lender may be pointless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good loan package will include a current business plan or key excerpts from your plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the statement of purpose, just discussed, and financial statements, which will be discussed in the next section, your loan package should include a current business plan or plan excerpts, with at least the following sections:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*Business description &amp; vision</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*Market definition and analysis</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*Description of products and services</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*And, a brief overview of your organization and management</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you do not have a business plan, or if you are not familiar with the components of a business plan, it is highly recommended that you take the time to educate yourself and to thoughtfully develop such a plan. At the conclusion of this course, there is section called “other resources.” You will find, in that section, a free online tutorial on how to prepare a business plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider visiting the tutorial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 17 Financial Statements</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Financial statements are a critical and necessary component of a loan request package. They tell a story about the financial capacity and performance of a business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A well prepared package will include four types of statements: cash flow statement, income statement, balance sheet and personal financial statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of these statements is discussed in the following sections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 18 Cash Flow Statement</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A cash flow statement is used to monitor and project incoming and outgoing cash, typically on a monthly basis. It helps you and your lender determine how much cash your business will have on hand at any point in time. If your business has or will have a negative cash position, it means that at a given point in time you have more money going out than coming in and you will probably not be able to pay your bills. Obviously, this type of information will get a lender’s attention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your package should include a current twelve month cash flow statement, projected for at least six months out. All cash projections should be realistic and supported.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click on the hyperlink to view an automated Cash Flow Statement Template. Use the template to compose a current and projected cash flow statement when you are ready.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 19 Income Statement</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The income statement is a measure of how a business has performed over a specific period of time, usually six months or one year. It measures all income less all expenses to arrive at the amount of profit or loss generated by the business for the period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your business is a new venture, your loan package should include a projected income statement, projected for twelve months out. If you are an existing business with a history, include income statements for the last three years, if available. Your lender may also request a current interim-income statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click on the hyperlink to view an automated Income Statement Template. Use the template to compose an income statement for your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 20 Balance Sheet</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The balance sheet represents the basic accounting equation: assets minus liabilities, equals net worth. It is a snap-shot of business financial capacity at a specific point in time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are a new business, your loan package should include a balance sheet representing assets and liabilities, as of your planned opening date, and another, projected for twelve months after your opening date. If an existing business, include balance sheets for the last three years, if available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click on the hyperlink to view an automated Balance Sheet Template. Use the template to compose a balance sheet for your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 21 Personal Financial Statement</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A personal financial statement is a simple balance sheet measuring net worth. It identifies personal assets and debts to help a lender determine a borrower’s net worth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This statement is important to the overall loan request, because it helps the lender evaluate a borrower’s financial capacity and ultimately the value of the personal guaranty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click on the hyperlink to view a Personal Financial Statement. Use the form to compose a personal financial statement your loan package.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 22 Loan Packaging Tips</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>OK…….. We have talked about what a lender will want to know and what should be in a loan package. Let’s now consider some helpful tips in pulling it all together. The loan package should:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>•Be brief, to the point and easy to read. This is important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>•It should emphasize the management strength of your business. Convince the lender that you and your team have the skills, passion and expertise to be successful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>•Your loan package should present attractive projections that paint a realistic picture with substantiated assumptions</p>\r\n\r\n<p>•Throughout the package you should weave in the theme: “this is how you will get your money back.” Lenders want to know how and will they get their money back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>•Importantly, proofread what you prepare. Better yet, have someone else go through it for spelling, grammar and style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>•And finally, learn from your mistakes. If you get rejected from one lender, find out why and FIX the problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 23 Loan Packaging Tips</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After you submit your loan request to a lender, how will it be evaluated?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your lender will review your request using three key credit factors. But first, its important to point out -- that lenders are in the business to make money and the way they make money is by making loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, a loan officer’s career is based on not making mistakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The bottom line…… </strong>you have to convince the lender that you and your business are a good risk. Your character, capacity and collateral, among other credit factors, will be considered by the lender in making a loan decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>•Character is actually a check on your financial status and personal credit history, including your previous loan payment record. The theory is -- people are creatures of habit – if you have repaid prior debts on time and in full, you will likely pay this requested loan on time. Also considered is experience in the type of business you are trying to finance, including level of responsibility, education and business management training. •Financial capacity is about having sufficient cash flow to pay-off a loan. This</p>\r\n\r\n<p>underlies the importance of preparing a cash flow statement with future cash projections before presenting your loan request to a lender. Doing so indicates that you are knowledgeable about the cash coming into your business and being spent. In the lender’s mind, it shows that you are “financially aware” and that you may be better able to avoid a cash shortage that would jeopardize making monthly loan payments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>•Lastly, while cash flow is the primary source of loan repayment, lenders will want a back-up or secondary source, as an “exit of last resort,” should your business not prove profitable. Collateral is that secondary source and it is important to the lender because it lowers risk. Remember, its all about lowering risk so the lender feels confident the loan will be paid on time and in full.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 24 Next Steps</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you have completed the course, take the next steps. Put what you have learned into action. Step 1. Identify potential or existing financial needs for your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 2. Test the waters by talking with a local lender about types of loans available to small businesses. Step 3. Talk with a mentor, business coach or SBA representative about all available small business loan products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 4. Prepare a draft loan package and review it with a lender, mentor or business coach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 25 Additional Assistance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many resources are available to assist you.

Importantly, \"controlled by Native Hawaiians,\" requires that both membership within the NHO and membership within the NHO's board to be at least 51% Native Hawaiian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, Native Hawaiian means any individual whose ancestors were natives, prior to 1778, of the area which now comprises the state of Hawaii.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 5 NHO Business Activities</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What is a Native Hawaiian Organization (NHO)?<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A Native Hawaiian Organization is any community service organization serving Native Hawaiians in the state of Hawaii which is a non-profit organization chartered by the state of Hawaii, is controlled by Hawaiians, and whose business activities will principally benefit such Native Hawaiians</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding the phrase \"business activities will principally benefit such Native Hawaiians,\" it is required that the NHO's bylaws describe the benefits Native Hawaiians will receive from the NHO. In addition, the NHO must have a detailed plan that shows how revenue earned by the NHO will principally benefit Native Hawaiians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 6 Business Development Growth</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>8(a) program is a business development tool that may fit within the economic development vision of the NHO or the business entities that are owned by the NHO</li>\r\n\t<li>Successful business development may be enhanced with a well-defined economic development framework and a strong foundational base of capabilities, strategies and supporting policies</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe 8(a) program is a tool, a business development tool that may fit within the economic development vision of the NHO or the business entities that are owned by the NHO.<br />\r\nWith that said, successful business development within a NHO may be enhanced with a well- defined economic development framework and a strong foundational base of capabilities, strategies and supporting policies. The 8(a) program is but one tool that may help support business development growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 7 Framework for Business Development Growth</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Assess<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What we know<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Strategic choices<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Identify opportunities<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Capabilities<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Alignment and delivery<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Action<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Adapting and learning<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mobilization<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Willingness to lead change</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Achieving business growth requires a plan. &nbsp;A well thought out plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As such, a tribal entity or NHO should have a good understanding of where it is today, where it has been and where it wants to go. &nbsp;Five steps can be applied to build a planning framework.<br />\r\nFirst, gather what you know and assess your current circumstances. Second, identify opportunities and make strategic choices. Applying to the 8(a) program, for instance, may be one of those choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Third, understand your tribal capabilities and align skills with what your tribe can successfully deliver. &nbsp;Fourth, identify and manage actions and lastly, but most importantly, mobilize change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 8 Structural Options</strong><br />\r\nGraphic of business structural options…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important for a NHO to understand how it can be optimally structured so it can be positioned for business development growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, a Native Hawaiian Organization may have more than one related 8(a) business. This slide shows one structural option, with two affiliated 8(a) firms. &nbsp;There are other options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 8 Reflection Reflection…</strong><br />\r\nDoes your Native Hawaiian Organization have a strong foundational base for economic development? Has NHO leadership considered ways the 8(a) program can be used as a business development tool? Is your NHO structurally positioned for optimal business development growth?<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Slide 9 8(a) Program &amp; Summary Program overview and summary.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 10 Program Purpose</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Help small disadvantaged businesses, including NHO owned businesses compete in the marketplace</li>\r\n\t<li>Provide business development support</li>\r\n\t<li>Prepare qualifying entities for procurement and other business opportunities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The 8(a) Program -- named for Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act - is designed to assist small disadvantaged businesses, including NHO owned businesses to compete in the marketplace. It is also designed to assist such entities in gaining access to federal and private procurement markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary focus of the program is to provide business development support, such as mentoring, procurement assistance, business counseling, training, financial assistance, surety bonding and other management and technical assistance to qualified firms. The ultimate objective, however, is to prepare small disadvantaged firms for procurement and other business opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the award of sole source and set-aside contracts, the 8(a) program provides market access and growth for qualified tribal enterprises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 11 Native Hawaiian Organization 8(a) Perspective</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>8(a) program is a business development tool for NHOs</li>\r\n\t<li>Federal agencies have strong incentives to contract with small firms owned by Native Hawaiian Organizations</li>\r\n\t<li>Special rules for NHO participation in the 8(a) program - an important perspective is that proceeds from NHO owned companies are used to benefit Native Hawaiians and the Native Hawaiian community as a whole, rather than individual owners and the NHO members and directors</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The program is a business development tool that offers opportunities for small businesses owned by Native Hawaiian Organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the 8(a) program, Congress granted such entities with unique rights in the federal procurement process. These rights provide federal agencies with strong incentives to contract with businesses owned by NHOs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Native Hawaiian Organizations do have special rules for participation in the 8(a) program. There are many reasons for this. However, an important perspective is that proceeds from NHO owned companies are used for the benefit of the entire NHO membership, rather than individual<br />\r\nowners, NHO members or directors. NHOs use these proceeds to build, sustain and operate their communities - for the betterment of education, health care, public works and other community sustaining activities.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Slide 12 Regulatory Guidance</strong><br />\r\nThe 8(a) Business Development Program:<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Established by:<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act of 1953<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Governed by:<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;13 CFR 124.100-124.704 (Subpart A)<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;FAR Part 19.800-19.812<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Specific References to Native Hawaiian Organizations:<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;13 CFR 124.3 -- Definitions<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;13 CFR 124.103 -- Who is socially disadvantaged?<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;13 CFR 124.105-106 -- Eligibility<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;13 CFR 124.109 -- Applying to the 8(a) program<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;13 CFR 124.112 -- Business criteria to remain eligible</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 8(a) program was established by Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act.<br />\r\nIt is primarily governed by 13 CFR 124 Subpart A and FAR Parts 19.8 - 19.812. Specific references to tribally owned businesses are also noted in the slide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 13 Key Program Objectives</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>\"Promote the business development of small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals…\"</li>\r\n\t<li>\"Promote the competitive viability of such concerns…\"</li>\r\n\t<li>\"Clarify and expand the program for procurement by the United States…\"</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>As articulated in statute and regulations, the key objectives of the 8(a) program are to promote business development of small business concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals; to promote the competitive viability of such concerns; and to use the tools of the program to help qualified small disadvantaged firms benefit from federal procurement opportunities.<br />\r\nQualifying NHO owned businesses can benefit from these key program objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 14 Term of Participation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Maximum 9 year participation in the program, beginning from the date of SBA approval</li>\r\n\t<li>First 4 years are considered the developmental stage</li>\r\n\t<li>Last 5 years are considered the transitional stage</li>\r\n\t<li>Continuation in the program is dependent on:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Remaining eligible as a socially and economically disadvantaged firm (includes all applicable requirements)</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Staying in compliance with the 8(a) BD participation agreement</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Participation in the 8(a) program is limited to 9 years, beginning from the date a firm is approved by the SBA as a certified 8(a) Business Development firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first four years in the program are considered the developmental stage. The last five years in the program are considered the transitional stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuation in the program, in both the developmental and transitional stages, is dependent on the firm's continuing eligibility as a socially and economically disadvantaged - owned and operated - firm and that the firm continues to be in compliance with the 8(a) business development agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 15 Summary Requirements and Goals</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Overall goal for 8(a) firms is to graduate from the program and thrive in a competitive business environment<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Requirements:<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Maintain a balance between commercial and government business<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SBA district offices monitor and measure the progress of participating firms<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Annual review<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Business planning<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Systematic evaluations</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 8(a) program is a business development program. As such, the overall goal for 8(a) firms is to graduate from the program and go-on to thrive in a competitive business environment. There are several requirements in place to help firms achieve this goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firms must maintain a balance between their commercial and government business.<br />\r\nIn addition, SBA district offices monitor and measure the progress of participating 8(a) firms. It does this through annual reviews, business planning collaboration and systematic evaluations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 16 Reflection Reflection…</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is the purpose of the 8(a) program aligned with the goals and objectives of your Native Hawaiian Organization? Is your NHO and its owned businesses positioned to take advantage of opportunities available through the 8(a) program?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 17 How the 8(a) Program Works How the 8(a) program works.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 18 Driven by Several Key Components</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SBA's role<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Business development assistance<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Business development support<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Contract opportunities<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Role of the tribal 8(a) program participant<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Capitalize on available business development assistance and support<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Learn about government buying needs<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Market to the government<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Submit information annually to the SBA to prove eligibility<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe program is driven by several key components. SBA plays a pivotal role, but the core of the program is focused on business development assistance, business development support, finding contract opportunities and marketing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important role, however, is played by 8(a) firms themselves. Each of these components is explained in the following sections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 19 SBA's Role</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Program policy guidance<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Review and certify eligible clients<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Assign SBA personnel, Business Opportunity Specialists, to 8(a) participating firms<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Provide business development assistance<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Help identify contract opportunities for 8(a) participating entities<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Review progress of 8(a) certified businesses</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the administrator of the program, SBA provides program policy guidance, reviews and certifies eligible clients, assigns SBA personnel -- Business Opportunity Specialists -- to approved 8(a) entities, provides business development assistance, helps in identifying potential contract opportunities and reviews the progress of participating 8(a) concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA's role is to build a strong resource-rich program -- that helps 8(a) certified, NHO owned businesses to become and remain competitive in the economic mainstream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 20 Business Development Assistance</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Business counseling and mentoring<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Online and traditional training<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Surety bond guarantees<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Contract marketing guidance<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Acquire federal government surplus property<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Other management and technical assistance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aiding 8(a) certified, NHO owned enterprises with business development assistance is core to the program. This assistance takes many forms, but includes, business counseling and mentoring; online and traditional training; surety bond guarantees; contract marketing guidance; acquiring federal government surplus property; and, other forms of management and technical assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Competitive strength comes from knowledge, financial support and technical assistance - all of which can be gained through SBA's business development initiatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 21 Business Development Support</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Helping firms:<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;register in the System for Award Management (SAM)<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;find contract opportunities<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;maintain a current business plan with a procurement strategy<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;and other support<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Working with agencies and prime contractors to direct contracts to small firms<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Assigning Business Opportunity Specialists(BOS)s to work individually with participating 8(a) firms</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Providing management, technical and financial assistance is one aspect of the program. Another key dimension is providing business development support to 8(a) clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, SBA also works with federal agencies and prime contractors ---- encouraging them to set aside, breakout or otherwise make contracts available to 8(a) and other small firms. In other words, SBA markets the technical capabilities of small businesses to federal buying entities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, each 8(a) firm is assigned a Business Opportunity Specialist by the SBA. The assigned specialist helps guide the 8(a) business during its tenure in the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 22 Contract Opportunities</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SBA staff and Procurement Center Representatives (PCRs) work closely with government and private organizations to identify procurement opportunities for small firms<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Government-wide procurement goals that benefit small businesses<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;23% -- Overall small business goal<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5% -- Small disadvantaged businesses<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5% -- Women owned small businesses<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3% -- Certified HUBZone firms<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3% -- Service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The federal government buys in excess of $600 billion dollars in goods and services each year. Government-wide procurement goals help define another aspect of the 8(a) program. Such goals establish procurement targets for agencies that benefit small disadvantaged businesses and other small firms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA personnel, specifically Procurement Center Representatives, work closely with government and private organizations to identify procurement opportunities for small businesses and to help target specific acquisitions for 8(a) participating firms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, government policy and SBA staff encourage federal agencies to meet or exceed annual small business procurement goals. The current government-wide goal for prime and subcontracts to small disadvantaged businesses is 5%. Overall, however, the government-wide small business goal for all prime contracts is 23%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other government-wide procurement goals include: 5 percent of prime and subcontracts for women-owned small businesses; 3 percent of prime and subcontracts for Hubzone businesses and &nbsp;3 percent of prime and subcontracts for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 23 Role of 8(a) NHO Owned Businesses</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SBA opens the door….<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;8(a) client firms must be competitive and market themselves competitively<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Successful 8(a)tribal firms capitalize on available business development resources, educate themselves on government buying needs, and market themselves based on skills and ability to meet such needs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, in describing how the program works, the most important role is played by the 8(a) firms, themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA may be able to open some doors, but it is up to the tribal 8(a) firms in the program to be competitive and to market themselves effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's all about preparation and self-marketing. Successful 8(a) firms capitalize on available business development resources, educate themselves on government and corporate buying needs, and market themselves based on their skills and ability to support the procurement needs of multiple organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 24 Reflection Reflection…</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can the 8(a) program be used successfully by your Native Hawaiian Organization as a business development tool? How can this be accomplished? Importantly, what specific steps should your NHO or related businesses take to make this happen?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 25 8(a) Program Eligibility for NHO Owned Businesses Program eligibility requirements for NHO owned businesses.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 26 Eligibility</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Special rules<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;NHO eligibility</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Eligibility for the 8(a) program is uniquely defined for Native Hawaiian Organization owned businesses. As such, there are special rules and unique NHO and NHO owned business eligibility requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 27 NHO Special Rules</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Companies owned by economically disadvantaged Native Hawaiian Organizations are eligible for participation in the 8(a) program and other federal programs requiring SBA to determine social and economic disadvantage as a condition of eligibility<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Such companies must meet all eligibility criteria set forth in 13 CFR 124.101 through<br />\r\n124.108 and 124.112 to the extent that they are not inconsistent with 13 CFR 124.110</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Companies owned by economically disadvantaged Native Hawaiian Organizations are eligible for participation in the 8(a) program and other federal programs requiring SBA to determine social and economic disadvantage as a condition of eligibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 29 Social Disadvantage</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Regarding social disadvantage and for the purposes of the 8(a) program, Native Hawaiians -- as defined in 13 CFR 124.3 -- are considered to be socially disadvantaged</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding social disadvantage and for the purposes of the 8(a) program, Native Hawaiians -- as defined in 13 CFR 124.3 -- are considered to be socially disadvantaged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 30 Economic Disadvantage</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SBA considers the economic status of the NHO's members to establish whether the NHO is economically disadvantaged<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Majority of an NHO's members must qualify as economically disadvantaged<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If the NHO does not have members, then a majority of the NHO's board of directors must qualify as economically disadvantaged</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding economic disadvantage, SBA considers the economic status of the NHO's members to establish whether the NHO is economically disadvantaged. The majority of an NHO's members must qualify as economically disadvantaged under 13 CFR 124.104.<br />\r\nIf the NHO does not have members, then a majority of the NHO's board of directors must qualify as economically disadvantaged. If the NHO has members and a board of directors, only a majority of the NHO's members must be economically disadvantaged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 31 Required Forms and Documents</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;NHO applicant is required to submit all of the same documents generally required by all other 8(a) applicants<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Specific documents required from the NHO include:<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Articles of incorporation, including amendments<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Bylaws and amendments<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Meeting minutes of NHO members and/or board of directors<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;List of all companies in which the NHO has ownership</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An NHO applicant is required to submit all of the same documents generally required by all other 8(a) applicants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, a NHO owned business is also required to submit additional documentation, including: articles of incorporation, with any amendments; bylaws and amendments; and, a list of all companies in which the NHO has ownership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you are ready, review the hyperlinked NHO checklist for greater clarity regarding required documentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 32 NHO Business Eligibility</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Legal business entity organized for profit<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Size<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ownership<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Control and management<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Individual eligibility limitation<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Potential for success</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are business eligibility requirements specific to NHO related firms. These requirements focus on the legal structure of the business, the size of the concern, ownership, control and management of the enterprise, individual eligibility limitation and the potential for success of the NHO business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 33 Legal Business Entity and Ownership</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Businesses owned by economically disadvantaged Native Hawaiian Organizations, as defined in 13 CFR 124.3, are eligible for 8(a) program participation<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Firms owned by the NHO must operate as \"for profit\"<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Firms must qualify as a small business<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;NHO cannot own 51% or more of another firm which, either at the time of application or for the previous two years, has been operating in the 8(a) program under the same primary NAICS code of the applicant</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Small firms owned by economically disadvantaged Native Hawaiian Organizations, as defined in 13 CFR 124.3, are eligible for 8(a) program participation. &nbsp;Such firms must operate as \"for profit\" entities and must qualify as small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, a NHO cannot own 51% or more of another firm which, either at the time of application or for the previous two years, has been operating in the 8(a) program under the same primary NAICS code of the applicant. A Native Hawaiian Organization may, however, own an 8(a) participating firm or applicant that conducts or will conduct secondary business in the 8(a) program under the same NAICS code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 34 Size</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;NHO owned applicant must qualify as a small business and certify as such to the SBA, pursuant to the provisions in 13 CFR 121<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In determining the small business size standard, the NHO owned business will be determined independently without regard to its affiliation with the Native Hawaiian Organization or any other business enterprise owned by the NHO</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business size matters. A NHO owned applicant must qualify as a small business concern as defined for purposes in 13 CFR 121. The particular size standard to be applied is based on the primary industry classification or NAICS code of the applicant concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, in determining the small business size standard, the NHO owned business will be determined independently without regard to its affiliation with the Native Hawaiian Organization or any other business enterprise owned by the NHO, unless the SBA Administrator determines that one or more such NHO owned businesses have obtained, or are likely to obtain, a substantial unfair competitive advantage within an industry category.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 35 Control and Management</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A NHO must control the NHO owned business and the business must be able to demonstrate that the NHO controls its board of directors<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;NHO's members (or directors if there are no members) must have managerial experience of the extent and complexity needed to run the NHO owned business<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Individual (or individuals) responsible for the daily operations of the NHO owned business does not need to establish personal social and economic disadvantage</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 36 Control and Management</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Management and daily business operations of an ANC owned business must be controlled by Alaska natives<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act stipulates that a business which is majority owned by an ANC is deemed to be both owned and controlled by Alaska natives<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Individuals responsible for the control and management of an ANC business do not need to establish social and economic disadvantage status<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Individuals responsible for the management and daily operations of the business may not manage more than two 8(a) program participants [Small Business Act 15 U.S.C.<br />\r\n§636(j)(11)(B)(iii)(ll)]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding control, the NHO must control the NHO owned business and the business must be able to demonstrate that the NHO controls its board of directors. &nbsp;In addition,<br />\r\nNHO's members, or directors if there are no members, must have managerial experience sufficient to run the NHO owned firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Individuals operating the NHO owned business do not need to demonstrate social and economic disadvantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 37 Individual Eligibility Limitation</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Individual eligibility limitation - there is none<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SBA does not deem an individual involved in the management or daily business operations of a tribally owned business to have used his or her individual eligibility within the meaning of \"one-time eligibility\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no individual eligibility limitation. That is, SBA does not deem an individual involved in the management or daily business operations of an NHO-owned business to have used his or her individual eligibility within the meaning of \"one-time eligibility,\" as described in 13 CFR 124.108(b).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 38 Potential for Success</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;NHO applicant may establish potential for success by demonstrating that:<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It has been in business for at least two years, as evidenced by income tax returns for each of the two previous tax years ; or<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Individual or individuals who will manage and control the daily business operations of the firm have substantial technical and management experience, the applicant has a record of successful performance on contracts from governmental or nongovernmental sources in its primary industry category, and the applicant has adequate capital to sustain its operations and carry out its business plan as an 8(a) participant; or<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;NHO has made a firm written commitment to support the operations of the applicant concern and it has the financial ability to do so</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An NHO owned business applicant may establish potential for success by demonstrating that:<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;it has been in business for at least two years, as evidenced by income tax returns for each of the two previous tax years showing operating revenues in the primary industry in which the applicant is seeking 8(a) certification; or<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;the individual or individuals who will manage and control the daily business operations of the firm have substantial technical and management experience, the applicant has a record of successful performance on contracts from governmental or nongovernmental sources in its primary industry category, and the applicant has adequate capital to sustain its operations and carry out its business plan as a participant; or<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;the NHO has made a firm written commitment to support the operations of the applicant business and it has the financial ability to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 39 Other Eligibility Criteria</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;NHO owned business may not be denied admission into the program due solely to a determination that specific contract opportunities are unavailable to assist the development of the applicant firm, unless:<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Government has not previously procured and is unlikely to procure the types of products or services offered by the concern<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Purchase of such products or services by the government will not be in quantities sufficient to support the developmental needs of the applicant and other program participants providing the same or similar items or services</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with other 8(a) applicants, a NHO owned applicant may not be denied admission into the program due solely to a determination that specific contract opportunities are unavailable to assist the development of the applicant firm, unless: the government has not previously procured and is unlikely to procure the types of products or services offered by the concern; or the purchase of such products or services by the government will not be in quantities sufficient to support the developmental needs of the applicant and other program participants providing the same or similar items or services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 40 Reflection Reflection…</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does your Native Hawaiian Organization and the related business or businesses within the NHO meet the eligibility requirements of the 8(a) program?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 41 Application Process The application process.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 42 Applying to the 8(a) BD Program</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;STEP 1. Verify NHO eligibility compliance<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;STEP 2. Gather what you need (supporting documentation)<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;STEP 3. Ask questions<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;STEP 4. Register in the System for Award Management (SAM)<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;STEP 5. Register in SBA's General Login System (GLS)<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;STEP 6. Complete and submit the online 8(a) program application</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you feel you are qualified and only when you are ready to apply - should you apply for 8(a) program certification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The application process is not difficult. However, like any important application process it does require solid preparation, meaningful thought and a certain level of due diligence. &nbsp;It makes sense to do it right, the first time. No business wants to waste time and resources going through the motions and then not realizing what is expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, we recommend that six steps be followed in the application process. Each of these steps is discussed in the following.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 43 Step 1 Verify NHO Eligibility Compliance</strong><br />\r\nBefore you begin the application process, verify NHO eligibility requirements:<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Must be able to meet the definition of an NHO and demonstrate economic disadvantage<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;NHO owned business must meet legal, size, ownership, character, management &amp; control and potential for success standards<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Review 13 CFR 124.101 - 124.108; 13 CFR 124.110; 13 CFR 124.112</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nNot every business enterprise is eligible for 8(a) program certification. Before you begin the application process, make sure you meet the core NHO eligibility requirements. &nbsp;This is step one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 44 Step 2 Gather What You Need Learn more about…</strong><br />\r\nNative Hawaiian Organization Checklist Sample 8(a) Program Application</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 8(a) program is statutorily authorized and specific eligibility requirements are strictly adhered-to and monitored by the SBA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you prepare to apply for 8(a) program certification, you will be asked to provide, identify, demonstrate and validate much information. Therefore, it's important to assemble key NHO, business, governance, ownership, tax and other pertinent information to have readily available during the application process and BEFORE you attempt to complete the electronic 8(a) program application. &nbsp;This is step two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 45 Step 3 Ask Questions</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You don't know what you don't know…<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Review eligibility requirements, checklist, blank 8(a) program application, documentation you gathered and then --- ASK QUESTIONS<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAs mentioned earlier, no business wants to waste time and resources going through the motions and then not getting what is expected. &nbsp;That is why step three is critical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You don't know what you don't know. Make a point of becoming informed. Review eligibility requirements, the checklist, blank 8(a) application, documentation you gathered, and then, importantly, ask questions of SBA district office staff and others, experienced and qualified in the 8(a) program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 46 Step 4 Register in SAM Learn more about…</strong><br />\r\nSystem for Award Management (SAM)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step four, register in the System for Award Management.<br />\r\nTo do business with the federal government and to be certified under the 8(a) program, you must register in the System for Award Management or SAM, which is a database and government- wide single point of vendor registration. Within the SAM system, you must also complete the Small Business Supplemental Page. Use the hyperlink to learn more about the SAM system and to register your NHO owned business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 47 Step 5 Access and Register in GLS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step five, access and register in the General Login System.<br />\r\nTo apply for 8(a) certification, you must register for an account in SBA's General Log-in System, more commonly referred to as GLS. The GLS system provides a single log-in point for all SBA services. This single-entry point streamlines and simplifies service delivery to our clients.<br />\r\nTo access the 8(a) program electronic application, you will first have to login to SBA's GLS system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 48 Step 6 Complete and Submit Application</strong><br />\r\nStep 6, complete and submit the 8(a) electronic application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 49 Reflection Reflection…</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is your NHO owned business ready to apply for 8(a) certification? Have you meaningfully considered each of the six 8(a) program application steps?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 50 Key Questions and Answers Key questions and answers.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 51 FAQs Learn more… 13 CFR 124</strong><br />\r\nNative Hawaiian Organization - FAQs 8(a) Program Certification - FAQs Acquire Surplus Property - FAQs<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes the best approach to learn about a program is to review frequently asked questions and answers. Several good sources for such information include: 13 CFR 124 -- which is a comprehensive review of the 8(a) program and developed in a question and answer format; Native Hawaiian Organization FAQs; 8(a) program certification FAQs; and, FAQs about acquiring surplus property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 52 Reflection Reflection…</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knowledge is power. Does your Native Hawaiian Organization know enough about the 8(a) program to consider using it as a business development tool for the NHO? Who are the other members of your NHO who could benefit from reviewing this training module about the 8(a) program?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 53 Resources and Tools Resources and tools.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 54 Resources and Tools</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Federal Acquisition Regulations<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;https://www.acquisition.gov/far<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Acquisition Central<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;https://www.acquisition.gov/<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;FAR Part 19 - Small Business Programs<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.acquisition.gov/far<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;System for Award Management (SAM)<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;www.sam.gov<br />\r\nNumerous resources are available to assist tribal enterprises in learning more about and participating in the 8(a) Business Development Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 55 Resources and Tools</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Federal Business Opportunities<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.fbo.gov<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SBA-Government Contracting<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.sba.gov/aboutsba/sbaprograms/gc/index.html<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Code of Federal Regulations (13CFR) (48 CFR)<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.gpoaccess.gov/cfr/index.html<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Learn more about:<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SBA Size Standards - http://www.sba.gov/category/navigation- structure/contracting/contracting-officials/eligibility-size-standards<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;8(a) Business Development Program - http://www.sba.gov/content/8a-business- development-0<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;WOSB Program - http://www.sba.gov/content/contracting-opportunities-women- owned-small-businesses<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;HUB Zone Program - http://www.sba.gov/content/hubzone-0<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Local (client) resources:<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SBA district office - http://www.sba.gov/localresources/index.html<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) - http://www.aptac- us.org/new/Govt_Contracting/find.php<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Government Contracting Classroom (free online courses) - http://www.sba.gov/gcclassroom<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SCORE chapter - http://www.score.org<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Small Business Development Center - http://www.asbdc-us.org/<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SBA/SBDC Program Office - http://www.sba.gov/content/small-business- development-centers-sbdcs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use these resources to become better informed and improve your chances of being a successful participant in the 8(a) program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 56 Find a Mentor</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SBA's Mentor-Protégé Program offers significant benefits to tribal 8(a) firms<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Technical and management assistance<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Prime contracting<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Financial assistance<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Qualification for other SBA programs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And finally, a very helpful resource program for NHO owned businesses certified in the 8(a) program is SBA's Mentor-Protégé Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This relationship building resource-initiative is designed to enhance the capability of NHO owned businesses and other 8(a) participants to compete more successfully for federal contracts.

And even if you don’t plan on having any partners or employees, the business plan helps you see what you will need to make your business succeed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 14 Your Business Plan: A Living Document</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your plan should be a continual work in progress with updates made as needed throughout the life of the company.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 15 Business Plan Sections</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A well written business plan will usually include the following sections; Click on each section to learn more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 16 The Legal Side</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 17 Moving..</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a solid business plan in hand, you can now turn your attention to legal matters associated with small business ownership. After the planning process has been completed, a prospective business owner should move from the conceptual state towards the actual legal formation of the business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The legal aspects of starting a business are complicated, and this primer course is not intended to fully discuss them. Consultation with an attorney may be necessary so that all legal consequences of business formation can be considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 18 Legal Aspects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically, the issue of business formation is concerned with taxes, both relating to the individual or individuals forming the business and for the business itself. Generally, there are several legal matters that prospective entrepreneurs should consider when deciding:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What should the legal structure of your business be?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This decision will have long‐term implications, so you will want to select the type of ownership that is right for your situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 19 Legal Aspects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In making the choice you will want to take into account the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‐Your vision regarding the size and nature of your business,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‐The level of control you with to have,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‐The level of structure you want and are willing to accept,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‐the business’s vulnerability to lawsuits,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‐tax implications of the various business structures,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‐expected profit or loss of the business,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‐whether or not you will need to business, and</p>\r\n\r\n<p>‐Your need for a way to cash out of the business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 20 Legal Aspects</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While there are five basic ownership forms, most initial businesses starting out begin as Sole Proprietorships. In fact, if you do not form another legal structure, your business will be classified as a Sole Proprietorship by default.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click on each topic to discover the options available to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you are finished with this section, click on the Continue button to move on to the next section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 21</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most cities, states, counties or tribes impose licenses and/or permits on a wide variety of businesses. Business licensing can differ from state to state, or by reservation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A business may be required to obtain various licenses and/or permits in order to operate. Here are some of the common types.

Most businesses must apply for an EIN regardless of whether or not they have employees. The EIN is used for filling federal income taxes for the business, to make sure employees are credited with social security taxes to be paid by the business, and to make sure employees are credited with the appropriate amount of income taxes withheld by the business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about and obtain an EIN, visit the internal Revenue Service website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 23 Federal Licenses &amp; Permits</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most small business do not require a federal license or permit, unless they are engaged in one of the following regulated activities: investment advertising, drug manufacturing, preparation of meat products, broadcasting, ground transportation or selling alcohol, tobacco and firearms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click on the Continue button to move on to the next section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 24 The Numbers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 25 Understanding the Numbers: Raising Capital</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need money to start and run a business, that’s a few will dispute. However, it is one thing to have seed money to get started in business and another to have sufficient capital to sustain the business during the startup phase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ability to estimate realistic start up costs and raise sufficient critical is to the success of your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this section, we will discuss estimating start up costs, ways to find needed capital, how to go about borrowing money, how to understand the numbers, and the accounting process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 26 Start‐up Costs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When starting a new business it is important to carefully estimate how much it will cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To do this you need to estimate your initial fixe costs, plus your estimated monthly expenses. Your monthly expenses should be projected for three to six months to allow the business to generate cash flow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your total estimated startup costs would then be calculated by adding your fixed costs to your monthly projections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click on the “Estimate Your Costs” icon to access the “Start‐up Costs Estimator.” When you are finished with this section, click on the Continue button to move on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 27 Finding Capital</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you know what cash you will need to have on hand, there are several important sources to consider when looking for funding to start or run your business. Keep in mind there is no easy path to take in looking for capital for your business. Each of the options has inherent pros, cons, and tradeoffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 28 Finding Capital</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You’ll have to consider all options to see what makes sense for your particular situation.

Therefore it’s important at the outset that you recognize the importance of these six financial fundamentals and familiarize yourself with how they are analyzed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 30 Financial Statements</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These elements compose the three primary financial statements: balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Click on each term to familiarize yourself with what makes up the financial statements.

After all, you wouldn’t want to waste your time or money selling services to people who are unlikely to buy from you. There are two methods to segment a market: geographical segmentation and customer segmentation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 36 Geographical Segmentation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Geographical Segmentation allows you to determine the needs of customers in certain geographical areas. Whether it’s international, national, or regional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 37 Geographical Segmentation Example: Convenience Store</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, a neighborhood convenience store owner would only send advertisements to people living within a half‐mile radius of his her store. Or you may choose to sponsor community events that surround the geographical area of your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 38 Customer Segmentation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, customer segmentation allows you to pursue those people most likely to buy your product or service based on how or why they purchase products. You’ll want to determine the preferences of lifestyles and hobbies of your target market to use as methods. Think about the customer who would naturally buy from you, are they young? Middle aged? Or elderly? Do they have an active or sedentary lifestyle? What income bracket do they fall into? Do they share common interests or tastes? Do they live in a particular region or live across the country?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 39 Bring It All Together</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now take a look back at your market research and try and find some common threads that tie together certain groups that make them likely targets for your business.

It compliments your business plan and in many ways is equally important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 43 Marketing Plan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your plan should identify customer groups that you can serve better than your competitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 44 Marketing Plan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>…and should help you tailor product offerings, pricing, distribution, promotional efforts, and services to those markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 45 Marketing Plan Sections</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good plan will help you focus on the target market products and services.

Simply put, it allows a firm to supply products it did not manufacture – as long as the products come from another small business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Small Business Act, as amended, imposes requirements that a firm receiving a supply-based small business set-aside, or 8(a) Business Development contract – other than the actual manufacturer – must provide the products of a small business. That is, a small firm receiving a set-aside or 8(a) contract for supplies in an amount greater than $25,000 -- may provide products it did not manufacture itself, as long as the products come from another small business located in the United States. The products may come from a large business if SBA issues a waiver.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the rule as amended in 2011 requires that a contractor – providing products it did not manufacture (such as a retailer, wholesaler or supplier) -- take ownership or possession of the furnished items – in a manner consistent with industry standards -- with its own personnel, equipment or facilities, before the products are provided to the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, the rule requires that contractors have less than 500 employees, be primarily engaged in the retail or wholesale trade, and normally sell the type of item being supplied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA has the authority to waive the Non-Manufacturer Rule requirement.

If a solicitation calling for more than one item requires offers on all or none of the items, an offeror may qualify as a small business by meeting the size standard for the item accounting for the greatest percentage of the total contract price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, procurements for supplies must be classified under the appropriate manufacturing NAICS code, NOT under the wholesale or retail trade NAICS codes.

In any case, a small business non-manufacturer cannot exceed 500 employees. It must be primarily engaged in the retail or wholesale trade, and normally sell the type of item being supplied. And further, it takes possession of the item or items with its personnel, equipment or facilities in a manner consistent with industry practice.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Slide 18 NMR Waivers (content divider) Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Non-Manufacturer Rule waivers.

A class waiver, which is issued only when no small business manufacturer exists within a specific industry, or an individual waiver, which is issued when there is</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>justification that no small business manufacturer exists that can meet the requirement on a specific solicitation.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Slide 20 Class Waiver</p>\r\n\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Applies to all items in a class of products</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Applies to categories of items and continues in effect unless revoked by SBA</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>No time limitation or duration</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Any government agency, business association, or interested party may request a waiver for a class of products</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Discovery of even one small business manufacturer for a single item in the class will justify denial of a request for a class waiver</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Learn more… 13 CFR § 121.1202 Narrative</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\r\n\t<p>A class waiver is issued only when no small business manufacturers exists within a specific industry. Such a waiver, is applied broadly to all set-aside solicitations and is used in combination with a GSA Product Service Code Number.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>A class waiver applies to all items in a class of products, which is defined as a subcategory within a six digit NAICS code. For example, Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing is 334, which is a sub- sector in the class of products. The six digit NAICS for electronic computer manufacturing is 334111.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Class waivers apply to categories of items and continue in effect unless revoked by SBA. A waiver of the Non-Manufacturer Rule for classes of products has no time limitation or duration. Any government agency, business association, or interested party may request a waiver for a class of products.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Importantly, the discovery of even one small business manufacturer for a single item in the class will justify denial of a request for a class waiver. The turn-around time for a class waiver request is about 60 days.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Slide 21 Class Waiver (cont)</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Learn more…</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>View the latest SBA Non-Manufacturer</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Class Waiver List&nbsp;&nbsp; --- &nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sba.gov/content/class-waivers\">http://www.sba.gov/content/class-waivers</a></p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>At your convenience, view the latest SBA Non-Manufacturer Class Waiver List.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Slide 22 Individual Waiver</p>\r\n\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Individual waiver to a specific solicitation may be considered when a contracting officer determines no small business manufacturers exist to meet requirement</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Such waivers:</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Narrowly applied to select contract line item numbers (CLINS) for a specific solicitation</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Must be in place prior to receipt of offers in order for a non-manufacturer to qualify as a small business for set-aside purposes</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Authorized in Section 8(a)(17) of the Small Business Act</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Learn more… 13 CFR § 121.1203</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>An individual waiver for a specific solicitation may be issued when no small business manufacturer exists that can meet the requirements of the solicitation.

A request for a waiver of a class of products should refer to a specific subdivision, or statement of product, within the NAICS Code Manual and Product Service Code Directory.</p>\r\n\r\n\t<p>Any individual or organization may request a waiver for a class of products. The requester should supply SBA with the relevant NAICS code and other identifying information concerning the item.

This is the second module in a four- part, Pre 8(a) Business Development Program, training series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 2 Introduction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>8(a) Business Development Program is designed to assist socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses</li>\r\n\t<li>Four-module education series designed to inform, educate and engage qualified small firms in the 8(a) business development program</li>\r\n\t<li>Module 2 Introduction to Federal Contracting</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The 8(a) program is a popular federal business development program designed to assist socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The four-part series is designed to inform, educate and engage qualified small firms in the 8(a) Business Development Program. Module 2, this module, serves as an overview of federal markets and describes how the government buys goods and services. It is an important learning exercise, in that it is foundational in describing how the federal procurement system works.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 3 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Course Contents Module 2 Introduction to Federal Contracting</p>\r\n\r\n<ol dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Scope of the Federal Buying Market</li>\r\n\t<li>Prime Contract Assistance</li>\r\n\t<li>Subcontracting Assistance</li>\r\n\t<li>How the Government Buys, The Rules Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR)</li>\r\n\t<li>Types of Contracts and Agreements</li>\r\n\t<li>Electronic Compliant Systems</li>\r\n\t<li>Resources and Assistance</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fNarrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Module 2, Introduction to Federal Contracting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This module provides prospective 8(a) firms with an overview of the federal buying market, describes available assistance programs to help small firms win prime and subcontracts, explains how the government buys goods and services, describes the types of contracts and agreements used by the government, discusses necessary electronic compliant systems to communicate with the government and finally, highlights key resources available to help 8(a) firms and other small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The remaining modules, when the series is complete, include information about federal contracting procedures and rules; how to market to the government and prime contractors to win contracts; sound proposal writing and pricing; and, business planning and operational management of an 8(a) participating firm. In addition, in this module and other modules within the series, many of the slides include highlighted boxes with specific FAR and CFR regulatory references to help users easily access more information about the content in the slides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 4 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Scope of the Federal Buying Market Content Divider</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 5 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Federal Market</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>U.S. government is the largest buyer in the world</li>\r\n\t<li>Federal agencies buy just about every category of commodity and service available</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The U.S. government is the world's largest buyer of products and services. Purchases by military and civilian installations amount to nearly $500 billion a year, and include everything from complex space vehicles to janitorial services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In short, the government buys just about every category of commodity and service available. There are significant opportunities for qualified and competitive 8(a) firms and other small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The government uses the North American Industry Classification System or NAICS codes to classify industries in which it buys goods and services. NAICS codes will be described in greater length later in the module.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 6 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Small Firms are the Engine for Growth</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Small businesses are the engine for economic growth in America</li>\r\n\t<li>Provide jobs, innovation and competition</li>\r\n\t<li>Government policy provides “maximum practicable” prime and subcontracting opportunities to small firms</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fSmall businesses have always been the engine for economic growth. They provide jobs, innovation and bring competition to the marketplace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Government’s procurement policy which encourages “maximum practicable” prime and subcontracting opportunities for small businesses is a catalyst for economic growth. With a government contracting market representing more than a half trillion dollars, it makes solid economic sense for 8(a) firms and other small businesses to seek federal contract dollars.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 7 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">What is a Small Business?</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Certain government programs only apply to small businesses</li>\r\n\t<li>Small business size standards are generally determined by the number of employees or annual business receipts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Certain government programs apply only to small businesses. The question then becomes, what is a small business, or more specifically, how do you determine if you are a small business?</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Over the years SBA has established and revised numerical definitions for all for-profit industries, and this numerical definition is called a \"size standard.\" It is almost always stated either as the number of employees or average annual receipts of a business concern. Small business size standards are further discussed later in this module.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 8 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">8(a) Firms in the Federal Market</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Currently, 7,000+ firms are participating in the 8(a) program</li>\r\n\t<li>In 2011, 8(a) firms benefited from more than $16.7 billion in federal contracts</li>\r\n\t<li>8(a) program is a business development program, not a contracts program</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Currently, there are some 7,000 firms participating in the 8(a) program. In 2011, certified 8(a) firms benefited from a vast menu of business development efforts and were successful in obtaining federal contracts that exceeded $16.7 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Remember, the 8(a) program is a business development program, not a federal contracts program. However, as with any program, some participants fair better than others. Those who tend to be the most successful are those who take full advantage of available business development opportunities, learn as much as possible about federal markets, develop a strong marketing campaign, align themselves with partners and mentors, evolve and grow their competitiveness and ultimately benefit from contracts -- as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 9 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Prime Contract Assistance Content Divider</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 10 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Helping Small Firms Win Prime Contracts</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Government-wide Contracting Goals</li>\r\n\t<li>Small Business Set-asides Rule of Two</li>\r\n\t<li>Non-manufacturer Rule</li>\r\n\t<li>Subcontracting Limitations</li>\r\n\t<li>Service-disabled Veteran Owned Small Business</li>\r\n\t<li>HUBZone</li>\r\n\t<li>Woman-Owned Small Business Program</li>\r\n\t<li>8(a) Business Development Program</li>\r\n\t<li>Small Business Size Standards</li>\r\n\t<li>Certificate of Competency (COC) Program</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Helping small businesses benefit from federal prime contracts is an obligation of all federal agencies and a key responsibility of SBA and its staff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Multiple programs and initiatives are available to support this effort. They include, government- wide contracting goals, small business set-asides including those that benefit 8(a) firms, small business size standards and SBA’s Certificate of Competency program. Each of these programs is discussed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 11 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Government Wide Contracting Goals Small Business</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Goal 23% Women Owned Small Businesses</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Goal 5% Small Disadvantaged Businesses</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Goal 5% Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Goal 3% HUBZone Certified Small Businesses Goal 3%</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Federal statute defines government-wide prime contracting goals. Such goals represent a primary tool in helping small firms be considered for government contracts. SBA plays a pivotal role in administering the government-wide goals initiative and works with individual agencies. The current, government-wide procurement goal is that at least 23% of all federal government contracting dollars should be awarded to small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, targeted sub-goals are established for women-owned small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, certified small firms located in HUBZones and service disabled veteran-owned small businesses. These targeted goals are 5%, 5%, 3% and 3%, respectively, and are meant to be subsets of the overall small business goal of 23 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 12 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Small Business Set-asides</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Small business set-asides are a critical tool</li>\r\n\t<li>Powerful vehicle for helping small firms win prime contracts</li>\r\n\t<li>Fundamental: Acquisitions that have an anticipated dollar value exceeding $3,000, but not over $150,000 are automatically reserved for small businesses</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn more FAR 19.5</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Small business set-asides are a powerful tool for helping small firms win federal prime contracts. In 2011, small businesses were awarded some $91.5 billion in federal prime contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Fundamentally, government buys that have an anticipated dollar value exceeding $3,000, but not over $150,000 are automatically reserved or set-aside for small businesses. This is required unless the contracting officer determines there is not a reasonable expectation of obtaining offers from two or more responsible small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 13 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Small Business Set-asides (cont)</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Influenced by:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Rule of Two</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Non-manufacture Rule</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Subcontracting Limitations</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Can apply to:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>8(a) Business Development Program</li>\r\n\t\t<li>HUBZone Program</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Women Owned Small Business Program</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Program</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Small business set-asides are influenced by the Rule of Two, the Non-manufacture Rule and Subcontracting Limitations. Further, contracts can be set-aside for small businesses certified in the 8(a) Business Development Program or the HUBZone Program. Or, they can be set-aside for qualified women owned small businesses or service disabled veteran owned small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 14 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rule of Two</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Acquisitions over $150,000 are to be set-aside for small businesses when there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two responsible small businesses</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn more FAR 19.502.2</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">For acquisitions over $150K they too are to be set-aside for small business, when there is a reasonable expectation that offers will be obtained from at least two responsible small business concerns, and the award can be made at a fair market price.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is important to note, consideration is first for a set-aside or sole source award under the 8(a), HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business or Woman Owned Small Business programs before a general small business set-aside. However, there is no order of precedence among 8(a), HUBZone, SDVOSB or WOSB programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>\fSlide 15 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Non-Manufacture Rule</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Set-aside small business acquisitions that are not for construction or service related contracts must utilize a small business manufacturer</li>\r\n\t<li>SBA may issue individual or class waivers to the non-manufacturer rule, if no small manufacturer exists</li>\r\n\t<li>Rule does not apply for contracts under $25,000</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn more FAR 19.001; FAR 19.1</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The non-manufacturer rule is an important provision impacting small business set-asides. For small business set-asides, other than for construction or service contracts, the prime contractor must utilize a small business manufacturer if the firm itself, is not doing the manufacturing to complete the work. In industries where the SBA determines there are no or very limited small business manufacturers, it may issue individual or class waivers to the non- manufacture rule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is important to note, for small business set-asides for supplies, the prime contractor must either qualify as a manufacturer or supply the product of a domestic small business manufacturer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 16 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Subcontracting Limitations</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Applies to contracts set-aside for small businesses when the contract amount exceeds $150,000\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Service At least 50% of the contract cost for personnel must be expended for employees of the small business</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Supply - Business must perform work for at least 50% of the cost of manufacturing the supplies, not including the cost of materials</li>\r\n\t\t<li>General construction Business must perform at least 15% of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of the materials, with its own employees.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn more FAR 19.508-e; FAR 19.811-3e</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Limitations on subcontracting apply to solicitations and contracts for supplies, services and construction, if any portion of the requirement is set-aside for small business and the contract amount exceeds $150,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This limitation applies to service contracts, such that at least 50% of the contract cost for personnel must be expended for employees of the small business. For supply contracts, the business must perform work for at least 50% of the cost of manufacturing the supplies, not including the cost of materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">And finally for general construction contracts, the business must perform at least 15% of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of the materials, with its own employees. For construction by special trade contractors, the business must perform at least 25% of the cost of the contract, not including the cost of the materials, with its own employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 17</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">8(a) Business Development Program</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>\f8(a) set-asides are a very popular vehicle for achieving agency small business and SDB contracting goals\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Sole source Competitive</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>8(a) firms are formally certified by SBA</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn more FAR 19.8; FAR 19.203</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The purpose of this training series is to help prospective 8(a) firms understand and engage in the 8(a) Business Development Program. The fact that contracting officers can set-aside purchases for small firms certified in the 8(a) program is a huge advantage and key aspect of the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In addition, 8(a) set-asides are a powerful tool for agencies to achieve small business and small disadvantaged business contracting goals. Importantly, an 8(a) set-aside can be facilitated as a sole source or competitive acquisition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 18</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">HUBZone Program</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Small business must have its principal office located in a HUBZone</li>\r\n\t<li>35% of the firm’s employees must reside within a HUBZone, or certify that at least 35% of employees engaged in a HUBZone contract will reside in a HUBZone or Indian reservation</li>\r\n\t<li>Firm must be at least 51% owned and controlled by a US citizen</li>\r\n\t<li>FAR 19.13</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Contracting officers can also set-aside purchases for small businesses located in designated HUBZones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To participate in this type of set-aside, a small firm’s principal office must be located in a HUBZone and at least 35% of the firm’s employees must reside within a HUBZone, or certify that at least 35% of its employees engaged in a HUBZone contract will reside in a HUBZone or Indian reservation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Certified 8(a) firms, if qualified can also be certified as HUBZone firms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 19 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Women Owned Small Business Program</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Small Business Act authorizes contract set-asides -- for certain NAICS codes -- for WOSBs and/or EDWOSBs</li>\r\n\t<li>Creates significant opportunities for women entrepreneurs</li>\r\n\t<li>Program helps agencies meet government-wide contracting goals</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn more FAR 19.15</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Changes to the Small Business Act now authorize contract set-asides for certain industries or NAICS codes - for women owned small businesses and/or economically disadvantaged women owned small businesses. It’s important to emphasize that only certain industries or NAICS codes are eligible for set-asides in the WOSB program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This change creates significant opportunities for women entrepreneurs and will help agencies to meet government-wide contracting goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Again, an 8(a) firm, if qualified can also self-certify as a Women Owned Small Business. Slide 20 Service Disabled Veteran Owned SB Program</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Tool to help achieve an agency’s SDVOSB contracting goal</li>\r\n\t<li>At least 51% owned and controlled by a service-disabled veteran</li>\r\n\t<li>Daily operations are controlled by a service-disabled veteran or care giver</li>\r\n\t<li>FAR 19.14</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">A contracting officer can also set-aside acquisitions for Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To participate in this type of set-aside, such businesses must be at least 51% owned and controlled by a service disabled veteran and the daily management operations of the concern must be controlled by a service-disabled veteran or caregiver. And, they must be a small business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 21 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Small Business Size Standards</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Size standards are established by the SBA and represent numerical definitions for specific NAICS codes</li>\r\n\t<li>Based on average annual sales or the number of employees</li>\r\n\t<li>Used to determine eligibility for government preferences and reservations for small businesses</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">SBA has established and continually updates numerical definitions for all industries or NAICS codes. This numerical definition is called a small business size standard. It is almost always stated either as the number of employees or the average annual sales of the business concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The government uses NAICS codes to classify industries in which it buys goods and services. All federal agencies must apply SBA’s size standards for contracts to be awarded to small firms. It is also important to note, only SBA can reconcile size protests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Use the hyperlinks to learn more about size standards, determine the applicable size standard for a specific NAICS code and/or learn more about NAICS codes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 22 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Certificate of Competency (COC)</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>If a prospective contractor is determined to be “non-responsible” by a contracting officer -- the small business is entitled to an independent review by the SBA</li>\r\n\t<li>SBA may issue a COC to the contracting officer requiring the award of that specific contract to the small business</li>\r\n\t<li>\fFAR 19.16</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The COC program is helpful to many small businesses, including 8(a) certified firms. If a prospective small business contractor is determined to be “non-responsible” by the contracting officer, the contracting officer is required to refer the matter to the SBA for a Certificate of Competency or COC review. Based on the review, the SBA may issue a certificate of competency declaring the “referred company” as sufficiently responsible for the purposes of receiving and performing the specific contract. Slide 23 Subcontracting Assistance Content Divider</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 24 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Find Subcontracting Assistance</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Subcontracting can be a profitable alternative for small firms</li>\r\n\t<li>Performing as a subcontractor can prepare a firm to be a prime contractor in the future</li>\r\n\t<li>SBA maintains a database of subcontracting opportunities.

If a small business is not ready or lacks the capabilities to bid competitively for prime contracts, it should consider opportunities available through subcontracting. SBA maintains a database of subcontracting opportunities. This searchable database is called SUB-Net.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Slide 25</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Subcontracting Assistance Program</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Prime contractors receiving contracts greater than the simplified acquisition threshold must agree to provide small businesses with the maximum practical opportunity to participate as subcontractors</li>\r\n\t<li>FAR 19.7</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Prime contractors receiving contracts greater than the simplified acquisition threshold must agree in the contract that small businesses, specifically veteran-owned small businesses, service disabled veteran owned small businesses, women-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and small disadvantaged businesses, including 8(a) firms will have the maximum practical opportunity to participate as subcontractors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As such, prime contractors are required to establish subcontracting plans describing who and how small businesses will participate as subcontractors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Slide 26</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Subcontracting Plans</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Subcontracting plans are for contracts over:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>$ 1.5 Million for construction</li>\r\n\t\t<li>\f$ 6.5 Million for all others</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Types of Subcontracting plans:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Individual subcontracting plan</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Master subcontracting plan</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Commercial subcontracting plan</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn more FAR 19.701</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subcontracting plans are required for contracts over $1.5 million for construction and $6.5 million for all others. There are three types of subcontracting plans: individual, master and commercial subcontracting plans.

Contracting officials use procedures outlined in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, commonly known as the FAR, to guide government purchases. The primary contracting methods used by the government are: Micro-purchases; Simplified Procedures; Sealed Bidding; Contract Negotiations; and, Consolidated Purchasing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each of these contracting methods is discussed in the following.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 30 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Rules Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>You have to know the rules, to play in the game</li>\r\n\t<li>Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) outlines the rules</li>\r\n\t<li>Key small business parts of the FAR include:</li>\r\n\t<li>Subpart 8.4 Federal Supply Schedules</li>\r\n\t<li>Part 13 Simplified Acquisitions</li>\r\n\t<li>Part 14 Sealed Bidding</li>\r\n\t<li>Part 15 Contracting by Negotiation</li>\r\n\t<li>Part 16 Types of Contracts</li>\r\n\t<li>Part 19 Small Business Programs</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Understanding the government’s procurement rules is critical to the success of a small business wanting to participate as a government contractor. The FAR is the roadmap for doing business with the government. It outlines all of the rules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is a comprehensive guide indexed by topic. It is an excellent resource tool. The most common FAR sections used by small business are: Subpart 8.4 Federal Supply Schedules; Part 13 Simplified Acquisitions; Part 14 Sealed Bidding; Part 15 Contracting by Negotiation; Part 16 Types of Contracts; and, Part 19 Small Business Programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Slide 31</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Credit Card Opportunities</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Individual government purchases under $3,000</li>\r\n\t<li>Competition not required</li>\r\n\t<li>Government credit cards are often used</li>\r\n\t<li>Micro-purchases are not reserved for small businesses</li>\r\n\t<li>70% of all government procurement transactions are facilitated with a credit card</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn more FAR 13.301</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fGenerally speaking, government purchases of individual items under $3,000.00 are considered micro-purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Such government buys do not require competitive bids or quotes and agencies can simply pay using a Government Purchase Card or credit card, without the involvement of a procurement officer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is important to note, about 70 percent of all government procurement transactions are for micro-purchases under$3,000 and are facilitated with a credit card. In fiscal year 2010, this represented over $19 billion dollars. Credit card opportunities in the government buying space are huge. All small businesses wanting to participate in federal contract markets, including 8(a) firms should make their firms available for credit card purchases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 32 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Simplified Acquisition Procedures</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Federal law streamlines government purchasing for buys under $150,000</li>\r\n\t<li>Instead of full and open competition, simplified procedures can be used</li>\r\n\t<li>Government purchases above $3,000, but under $150,000 are reserved for small businesses</li>\r\n\t<li>Federal Business Opportunities www.fbo.gov</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn more FAR 13.000-13.501</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act and other statutory amendments removed many competition restrictions on government purchases under $150,000. Instead of full and open competition, agencies can use simplified procedures for soliciting and evaluating bids up to $150,000. Government agencies, however, are still required to advertise all planned purchases over $25,000 in Federal Business Opportunities or the FBO (www.fbo.gov), the government’s online listing and database of available procurement opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Simplified procedures require fewer administrative details, fewer approval levels, and less documentation. The procedures require all federal purchases above $3,000, but under $150,000, to be reserved for small businesses, an important point. This small business set-aside applies, unless the contracting official cannot obtain offers from two or more small firms who are competitive on price, quality and delivery.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 33 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sealed Bidding</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Competitive buying method for specific and clear government requirements</li>\r\n\t<li>IFB “Invitation for Bid” is the method used for the sealed bid process</li>\r\n\t<li>Contract is awarded to the lowest bidder who is fully responsive</li>\r\n\t<li>IFBs are available online for review at: www.fbo.gov</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn more FAR 14.101-14.105</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sealed bidding is how the government buys competitively when its requirements are very specific, clear and complete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fAn IFB or “Invitation For Bid” is the method used for the sealed bid process. Typically, an IFB includes a description of the product or service to be acquired, instructions for preparing a bid, the conditions for purchase, delivery, payment and other requirements associated with the bid, including a deadline for bid submissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Each sealed bid is opened in a public setting by a government contracting officer, at the time designated in the invitation. All bids are read aloud and recorded. A contract is then awarded by the agency to the lowest bidder who is determined to be fully responsive to the needs of the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Government-wide IFBs are available daily for review in the government’s online listing service, Federal Business Opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 34 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Contracting by Negotiation</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Preferred method in many federal procurement actions</li>\r\n\t<li>Typically used for contracts that will exceed $150,000 and when highly technical products and services are being sought</li>\r\n\t<li>RFPs &amp; RFQs are primary government request vehicles</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Contract negotiations are used in many federal procurement actions. This is typically a more complicated process for companies wanting to sell to the government. It is also a method that is more time consuming for buying agencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This is how it works..... In certain cases, when the value of a government contract exceeds $150,000 and when it necessitates a highly technical product or service, the government may issue a Request for Proposal. In a typical RFP, the government will request a product or service it needs, and solicit proposals from prospective contractors on how they intend to carry out that request, and at what price. Proposals in response to an RFP can be subject to negotiation after they have been submitted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">When the government is merely checking into the possibility of acquiring a product or service, it may issue a Request for Quotation (RFQ). A response to an RFQ by a prospective contractor is not considered an offer, and consequently, cannot be accepted by the government to form a binding contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Government-wide RFPs and RFQs are also available daily for review in the FBO.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 35 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Consolidated Purchasing Vehicles</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Most government agencies have common purchasing needs.</li>\r\n\t<li>Centralized purchasing or procurement vehicles are used to realize economies of scale</li>\r\n\t<li>Multiple Award Schedules, such as GSA Schedules, Agency Wide Multiple Award Schedules or Government Wide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs) are important contracting vehicles</li>\r\n\t<li>\fLearn more FAR 2.101(b); DFARS 207.170</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most government agencies have common purchasing needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sometimes the government can realize economies of scale by centralizing the purchasing of certain types of products or services. This is called consolidated purchasing and multiple award, acquisition vehicles are typically used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The most common multiple award schedules are GSA Schedules or Government Wide Acquisition Contracts, called G-WACs. These centralized buying vehicles are negotiated by the government with awards to many potential vendors and are used by multiple agencies buying goods and services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Most recently and importantly, under the Jobs Act of 2010, contracting officers can reserve orders of participation on contracts with multiple awards, including GSA multiple award schedules.

The appropriate type of indefinite-delivery contract may be used to acquire supplies or services when the exact times or exact quantities of future deliveries are not known at the time of contract award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Indefinite-quantity contracts are also known as delivery-order contracts or task-order contracts. A definite-quantity contract provides for delivery of a definite quantity of specific supplies or services for a fixed period, with deliveries or performance at designated locations. A requirements contract provides for filling actual purchase requirements for supplies or services during a specified contract period - from one contractor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">An indefinite-quantity contract provides for an indefinite quantity of supplies or services during a fixed period.

The Prompt Payment Act, which was enacted in the mid- 1980’s requires government agencies to pay small business contractors within thirty days after the receipt of the invoice. However, for the thirty day clock to start the invoice, as received, must be deemed “proper” under the law. If it is not deemed proper it will be sent back to the requesting contractor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is important that a business submitting an invoice fully understand the requirements of the agency it is dealing with, provide current and accurate information to the agency concerning the invoice and make certain that the Electronic Funds Transfer information, provided by the firm in the System for Award Management database, is current and correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is also important to note that President Obama introduced a temporary, transitional policy Quick Pay -- directing agencies to make contract payments faster to all of their prime contractors, with the understanding that those contractors will pass along accelerated payments to their subcontractors. This policy is an extension of provisions in the Jobs Act to make federal contracting more efficient. Quick Pay will cut processing time in half, from 30 days to 15 days, so cash will flow to small businesses and other firms serving as prime and subcontractors quicker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 52 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Electronic Funds Transfer</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Government policy requires that all contractors be paid by ETF</li>\r\n\t<li>In making ETF payments government uses data in the System for Award Management</li>\r\n\t<li>8(a) firms must be registered in SAM and keep information in the SAM database current and correct</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Current government policy requires that all contractors be paid by Electronic Funds Transfer. Again, as was just mentioned in the previous slide, in making EFT payments the government uses the information contained in the System for Award Management database. To be paid, a firm must be registered in SAM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This policy underscores the need for 8(a) firms and all businesses wanting to do business with the government to register in the System for Award Management and to make sure that information entered is always current and correct.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 53 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Resources and Assistance Content Divider</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>\fSlide 54 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Resources and Tools</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Federal Acquisition Regulations\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>https://www.acquisition.gov/far</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Acquisition Central\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>https://www.acquisition.gov/</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>FAR Part 19 Small Business Programs\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>http://www.acquisition.gov/far</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Code of Federal Regulations (13CFR)\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>http://www.gpoaccess.gov/cfr/index.html</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Federal Business Opportunities http://www.fbo.gov</li>\r\n\t<li>SBA-Government Contracting\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>http://www.sba.gov/aboutsba/sbaprograms/gc/index.html</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Numerous resources are available to assist individuals who are interested in learning more about and participating in the 8(a) Business Development Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 55 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Resources and Tools</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Learn more about:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>8(a) Program Certification FAQs - https://sba8a.symplicity.com/applicants/faqs</li>\r\n\t\t<li>SAM Registration http://www.sam.gov</li>\r\n\t\t<li>SBA Size Standards - http://www.sba.gov/category/navigation-structure/contracting/contracting-officials/eligibility-size-standards</li>\r\n\t\t<li>8(a) Business Development Program - http://www.sba.gov/content/8a-business-development-0</li>\r\n\t\t<li>WOSB Program - http://www.sba.gov/content/contracting-opportunities-women-owned-small-businesses</li>\r\n\t\t<li>HUB Zone Program- http://www.sba.gov/content/hubzone-0</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Local (client) resources:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>SBA district office - http://www.sba.gov/localresources/index.html</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) - http://www.aptac-us.org/new/Govt_Contracting/find.php</li>\r\n\t\t<li>SCORE chapter - http://www.score.org</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Small Business Development Center - http://www.asbdc-us.org Women’s Business Center - http://www.awbc.biz/locate.asp</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative Use these resources to become better informed and improve your chances of being a successful participant in the 8(a) program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Slide 56 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Contact Us...</p>\r\n\r\n<ul dir=\"ltr\">\r\n\t<li>Thank you for taking the time to learn about the 8(a) Business Development Program</li>\r\n\t<li>Please contact us with any questions you may have</li>\r\n\t<li>This is the second module in a four-part Pre-8(a) Business Development Program, training series</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">\fU.S. Small Business Administration Office of Government Contracting and Business Development 800 U-ASK SBA</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Thank you for taking the time to learn about the 8(a) Business Development Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Much information has been discussed and we hope it is helpful.

Welcome to Module 3, Winning Contracts. This is the third module in a four-part, Pre 8(a) Business Development, training series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 2 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Introduction</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>8(a) Business Development Program is designed to assist socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses</li>\r\n\t<li>Four-module education series intended to inform, educate and engage qualified small firms in the 8(a) program</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 8(a) program is a federal program designed to assist socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses. The four-part training series is intended to inform, educate and engage qualified small firms in the 8(a) program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 3 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Course Contents</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Federal Contracts</li>\r\n\t<li>Marketing to the Government &amp; Prime Contractors</li>\r\n\t<li>Capture Management</li>\r\n\t<li>Proposal Preparation</li>\r\n\t<li>Cost &amp; Pricing</li>\r\n\t<li>Building Relationships</li>\r\n\t<li>Resources and Assistance</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Module 3, Winning Contracts is divided into seven unique sections, each covering a specific topic. Woven together the sections create an information composite designed to help prospective 8(a) firms understand how to sell goods and services to the government. Specific topics in this module include: federal contracts; marketing to the government and prime contractors; capture management; proposal preparation; cost and pricing; building relationships; and, resources and assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\fThe other modules in the series provide prospective 8(a) firms with an overview of federal contracting; describe federal contracting procedures and rules; and, discuss business planning and operational management of an 8(a) participating firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 4 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Federal Contracts</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 1, federal contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 5 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Federal Market</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>U.S. government is the largest buyer in the world</li>\r\n\t<li>Federal agencies buy just about every category of commodity and service available</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. government is the world's largest buyer of products and services. Purchases by military and civilian installations amount to nearly $600 billion a year, and include everything from complex space vehicles to janitorial services. In short, the government buys just about every category of commodity and service available. There are significant contract opportunities available for qualified and competitive 8(a) firms and other small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 6 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>8(a) Program, Firms and Benefits</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Help small disadvantaged businesses compete in the marketplace</li>\r\n\t<li>Provide business development support</li>\r\n\t<li>Prepare small disadvantaged firms for procurement and other business opportunities</li>\r\n\t<li>Currently, 7,000+ firms are participating in the 8(a) program</li>\r\n\t<li>In 2012, 8(a) firms benefited from more than $16 billion in federal contracts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 8(a) program is designed to assist small disadvantaged businesses compete in the marketplace. It is also designed to assist such companies in gaining access to federal and private procurement markets. It’s important to understand that participation in the 8(a) program is no guarantee that you will get a government contract. However, the program has been a ‘springboard’ to success for many small disadvantaged businesses which have leveraged the business development support services, such as mentoring, procurement assistance, counseling, training, and other management assistance to succeed. The ultimate objective, however, is to prepare small disadvantaged firms to compete for procurement and other business opportunities. Success in the 8(a) Program can be tied directly to the firm’s commitment and efforts to the program’s objectives. Through the award of sole source and set-aside contracts, the 8(a) program provides market access and growth for qualified businesses. Currently, there are some 7,000 firms participating in the 8(a) program. In 2012, certified 8(a) firms benefited from a vast menu of business development efforts and were successful in obtaining federal contracts that exceeded $16 billion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 7 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>8(a) Contracts</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>SBA is authorized to enter into contracts with other federal agencies and then subcontract with firms eligible for 8(a) program participation</li>\r\n\t<li>\fSBA may delegate its authority to other federal agencies</li>\r\n\t<li>Certified 8(a) firms can potentially receive sole-source contracts\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>up to $4 million for goods and services – up to $6.5 million for manufacturing</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are contracts authorized by the 8(a) program? Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act authorizes the SBA to enter into all types of contracts with other federal agencies and then “subcontract” these contracts with firms eligible for 8(a) program participation. Firms subcontracting to the SBA under the program are referred to as 8(a) contractors and the subsequent contracts are known as 8(a) contracts. To make the program more efficient and to leverage its use, SBA has the authority to delegate its 8(a) program contract execution authority to other federal agencies – which it does. Contracts awarded under the program may be awarded on either a sole source or competitive basis. Certified 8(a) firms have the potential to receive sole-source contracts, up to $4 million for goods and services requirements and up to $6.5 million for manufacturing requirements. As such, 8(a) contracts are an important business development vehicle for 8(a) participating firms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 8 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marketing to the Government &amp; Prime Contractors</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 2, marketing to the government and prime contractors. In this section we look at how 8(a) firms and other small businesses can market their goods and services to the federal government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 9 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marketing to the Government</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marketing to the government is different from marketing to the private sector, but there are many similarities. In this section we discuss how to define your products and services in government terms; register in the government’s database; develop a compelling business profile and capability statement; find government contracts and subcontracts; market directly to agencies; subscribe to bid- matching services; use procurement vehicles; and, describe the importance of working with SBA’s Business Opportunity Specialists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 10 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Define Products and Services</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Government/firms use the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) to identify products and services</li>\r\n\t<li>DOD uses Federal Supply Group and Class (FSG/FSC)</li>\r\n\t<li>Commercial and Government Entity (CAGE) code used to identify a facility at a specific location</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first step is defining your products and services. Government agencies use the North American Industry Classification System, more commonly referred to as a NAICS code, to identify products and services by industry type. The NAICS code is a six digit number that describes a particular product or service a company supplies. A firm will generally have a primary NAICS code, but can have multiple NAICS codes as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\fYou can find the NAICS codes for your products and services by clicking on the referenced hyperlink. It is also important to note that you can use your NAICS code or codes to conduct online searches at the websites of numerous federal agencies to learn what they are buying. To participate in contract opportunities within the Department of Defense, a firm will also need to know its Federal Supply Group or Class code. In addition, the Commercial and Government Entity or (CAGE) Code is a five-character ID number used extensively within the federal government. The CAGE code is used to support a variety of mechanized systems throughout the government and provides a standardized method of identifying a given facility at a specific location.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 11 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Register in SAM</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The System for Award Management (SAM) is the primary source for agencies to learn about prospective vendors</li>\r\n\t<li>Government maintained database</li>\r\n\t<li>A firm must register in the SAM to participate as a seller in the Federal space</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The System for Award Management, more commonly known as SAM, is the primary source for agencies to learn about prospective vendors. SAM is a government-maintained free database of companies wanting to do business with the government. This database is a marketing tool for businesses and a searchable list of prospective vendors for the government. The SAM system replaces and consolidates the capabilities of the Central Contractor Registry (CCR), the Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) and the Excluded Parties List (EPLS). A firm must register in the SAM system to participate as a seller in the federal space. Further, a firm’s profile in SAM must be updated at least once every 12 months – for the profile to stay active. Completing an accurate and appealing small business profile in the government’s SAM system is an important, foundational step in marketing your goods and services to the federal government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 12 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Develop a Compelling Small Business Profile</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>SAM profile is important. Small businesses should:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Learn as much as possible about the SAM system</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Access the SAM site and perform multiple searches as if you were hiring a firm similar to your business</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Treat your profile as if it were your business resume</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Get feedback about your SAM profile and revise it accordingly</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Update your profile annually or sooner if necessary</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Registering in the SAM system is an important marketing tool for your 8(a) firm. As such, you should learn as much as possible about the SAM system. That includes accessing the SAM site and performing multiple searches, as if you were looking to hire a firm similar to your own business. Review profiles of businesses in similar areas of expertise and use them as a guides when developing your own business profile. Also, treat your SAM and Dynamic Small Business Profile as your business resume. And, as with any resume, it should be regularly reviewed, updated and strengthened. Importantly,&nbsp;spelling and grammar do matter as they reflect your attention to detail and can form a contracting officer’s first impression of your firm. Finally, get feedback. This is critical. When you talk with your BOS, contracting officers, mentors and other procurement professionals ask them for a candid appraisal of your SAM profile. This information should be used to make necessary adjustments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 13 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prepare a Quality Capability Statement</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Prepare a comprehensive Capability Statement outlining management, technical and business strengths</li>\r\n\t<li>Statement should include:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Specific capabilities and skills</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Past performance history, with specific projects</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Awards and commendations</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Resumes of key management</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Seek feedback and refine accordingly</li>\r\n\t<li>Will serve as an important foundational element in the preparation of proposals that respond to government solicitations</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A business should prepare and maintain a comprehensive-yet concise-capability statement that clearly outlines its management, technical and business strengths. This too is important! Such a statement should include specific capabilities and skills, past performance history, awards and commendations, and resumes of key management personnel. A contracting officer’s time is limited and valuable. A simple one page capability statement is more likely to be viewed, while a 5-10 page document may be tossed on a pile. There’s time later on for a more detailed description of your firm’s capabilities. Initially, you just want to pique their interest in you. As with your SAM profile, you should seek regular feedback on your capability statement and refine and update it accordingly. Your capability statement will likely serve as a foundational element in preparing proposals in response to government solicitations. The importance of developing and maintaining a solid and meaningful capability statement is, again echoed in a later section on proposal preparation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 14 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find Contract Opportunities</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Federal government lists contract opportunities online at www.fbo.gov</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn more about FBO: User Guides, Training Videos &amp; FAQs</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knowing how to find contract opportunities is critical. A key resource is the government’s website, Federal Business Opportunities. To outreach contract opportunities to the public, the federal government operates a robust, online service called Federal Business Opportunities, but more commonly known as FBO or FedBizOpps. This single entry, government-wide website profiles available business opportunities and is one of the most powerful tools available to help you become successful in government contracting. The online tool identifies contract opportunities over $25,000.00. Firms can also view past awarded contracts in the FBO – which may help you with preparing future proposals or bids. It can pinpoint contracting offices which regularly buy the types of goods and services you sell, thereby identifying points of contact for your marketing efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\fThe FBO is a very powerful tool. It is important that your 8(a) firm become familiar with how to fully use all aspects of this tool. The referenced FBO hyperlinks are very helpful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 15 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Find Subcontract Opportunities</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Subcontracting or teaming can be profitable</li>\r\n\t<li>Performing as a subcontractor can prepare you to be a prime contractor in the future</li>\r\n\t<li>SBA maintains a database of subcontracting opportunities. This searchable database is called SUB-Net</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An alternative to seeking prime contracts is to explore subcontracting opportunities. Subcontracting with a prime contractor can be a profitable experience as well as a growth opportunity for a business. If, after assessing the capabilities and capacity of your business, you conclude that you are not ready to bid competitively for prime contracts, you should consider opportunities available through subcontracting. To help small businesses find opportunities, SBA maintains, SUB-Net, a searchable database of available subcontract opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 16 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Market Directly to Agencies</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Market products directly to federal agencies and large prime contractors</li>\r\n\t<li>Participate in procurement related conferences, activities and matchmaking events</li>\r\n\t<li>Take advantage of training and networking opportunities identified on SBA’s local district office websites</li>\r\n\t<li>Discuss agency strategies with BOS</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marketing your 8(a) firm directly to targeted agencies or prime contractors is also a powerful tool. Direct marketing is achieved by learning what agencies or prime contractors have a need for and then clearly demonstrating to them how your firm can fill specific needs and add value. In addition, you can participate in procurement related conferences, industry day activities and matchmaking events. These activities will help you become known to agencies, key “contract players” and other participants in the procurement arena. Also, visit your local SBA district office website. While at that site -- by clicking on events – you can learn about training and networking opportunities. Finally, and importantly, talk with your Business Opportunity Specialist about specific agencies and how you can reach out to them. Target your marketing by taking the time to identify who your federal customers may be. Go beyond the contracting activity’s Small Business Specialist and contracting officers. Find out who the actual customer is, program chief, etc. and make contact with that individual. Keep in mind, “blast e-mails” may be easy to do, but tend to be treated as spam and are deleted without being read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 17 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subscribe to Bid Matching Services</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Some companies subscribe to bid-matching services</li>\r\n\t<li>Provide contract leads that match a client’s qualifications</li>\r\n\t<li>PTAC’s offer free bid-matching services</li>\r\n\t<li>Find your local PTAC</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\fTo help find contract opportunities, some companies subscribe to bid-matching services. Such services provide leads on prospective contract opportunities that match a business’s qualifications. These services can do much of the work associated with finding contract opportunities, but the business still has to prepare the bid and win the contract. A small business can subscribe to a free bid-matching service through its local Procurement Technical Assistance Center. Other bid-matching services, including some which charge fees for their services, are also available. As with any fee-for-service provider, do your homework before entering into any agreements. Check their references before committing. The PTACs are often familiar with bid matching services, so ask a counselor about the firm’s success and reputation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 18 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use Procurement Vehicles</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Consolidated purchasing vehicles</li>\r\n\t<li>Multiple Award Schedules\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Learn about GSA Schedules – Learn about GWACS – Some agencies offer agency-wide contract vehicles</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Some Multiple Award Schedules maybe reserved specifically for 8(a) participating firms</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Federal government tries to benefit from economies of scale and make it easier for vendors to sell to the government by establishing Multiple Award Schedules. These schedules are often referred to as procurement vehicles. Two examples of this type of contracting include General Services Administration (GSA) Schedules and Government Wide Acquisition Contracts or (GWACs). Under the GSA Schedule, GSA negotiates prices and terms with prospective vendors and enters into an agreement with those vendors. Under the agreement, participating government agencies can purchase products and services from a schedule of prospective vendors, according to prices and terms already agreed to by the vendors. It is also important to note that some agencies offer agency-wide contract vehicles. Procurement vehicles can be valuable tools for small businesses to gain access to contract opportunities. Importantly, some multiple award schedules are exclusively set-aside for 8(a) participating firms. Also, be sure to be capable of accepting credit card payments, as many schedule and other purchases are made using credit cards as the preferred method of payment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 19 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Work Closely with Your BOS</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>SBA assigned Business Opportunity Specialists help prospective and existing 8(a) firms benefit from the program</li>\r\n\t<li>Assist clients with eligibility and program requirements, planning, goals and business assistance</li>\r\n\t<li>Assist clients with government contracting programs and opportunities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SBA assigns each participating 8(a) firm with a Business Opportunity Specialist (BOS) to help the firm benefit from the 8(a) program. This SBA staff person can be very helpful. BOSs are trained to help prospective and existing 8(a) firms with eligibility and program requirements, planning, goals and business assistance. They are also skilled in helping 8(a) firms benefit from government contracting programs and opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\fIt makes good business sense to work closely with your BOS.

So we have discussed the basic strategies behind marketing to the government. The next step is pulling it all together in a strategic approach defined as capture management. Capture management is a process or approach designed to help a firm win federal contracts. It is about positioning a prospective vendor as the “best solution” to filling a government need. Capture management typically includes: identifying opportunities your firm is capable of handling; knowing your customer; positioning your firm to fill specific needs; and, developing a clear strategy and winning approach. It’s an overall strategic approach to winning government business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 22 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Identify Opportunities</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Discovering government needs – you can fill</li>\r\n\t<li>Finding opportunities by:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Talking frequently with your assigned BOS</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Using the FBO/FedBizOpps website (www.fbo.gov)</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Talking directly with agencies</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Re viewing procurement forecasts</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Participating in industry conferences</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Networking with mentors, coaches and industry coaches</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is impossible to sell your products or services to the government, if you don’t know which agencies are buying, what their needs are and when they are buying. Identifying opportunities is about discovering government needs -- you can fill. You can identify government opportunities by talking frequently with your assigned Business Opportunity Specialist, using the FBO website, talking directly with agencies, reviewing procurement forecasts, participating in industry conferences and networking with mentors, coaches, resource partners such as PTACs and SBDCs, and other industry experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 23 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Know Your Customer</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Knowing your customer is good business</li>\r\n\t<li>\fIf you want to sell to a government agency you should understand the agency and its needs</li>\r\n\t<li>Resource tools include:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Agency websites</li>\r\n\t\t<li>BOSs</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Mentors</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Conferences</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Web search engines</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Trade organizations</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knowing as much as possible about your customers or prospective customers is just good business.

This is not just about elevating your profile and putting together a good looking proposal, it’s about substantiating your substance as a viable solution provider. Positioning to win includes: responding on-time, accurately and in a professional manner to an RFP or other government solicitation; demonstrating a clear understanding of the government’s need and offering a straight-forward solution; offering fair and competitive pricing; and, showing evidence of success through past performance and achievements. Positioning your firm is articulated more thoroughly in the next section, proposal preparation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 25 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strategic Approach to Winning Contracts</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Capture management is an overall strategic approach to winning federal contracts\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Identifying 8(a) and other contract opportunities you can fill</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Knowing your government customers</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Positioning your firm as the best solution provider</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\fIn summary -- capture management is an overall strategic approach to winning federal contracts.

This section provides an overview of the government’s solicitation process and explains how to prepare a proposal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 27 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Types of Solicitations</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Government contracting is big business</li>\r\n\t<li>Bid package is usually a set of documents to which a bidder would develop a responsive proposal</li>\r\n\t<li>Solicitations used by the government typically come in three formats\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Request for Quote (RFQ) – Request for Proposal (RFP) – Invitation for Bid (IFB)</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we have noted in this and other pre-8(a) training modules, government contracting is big business with thousands of contracts -- in hundreds of billions of dollars -- being executed by the federal government each year. The bid packages used by the government usually contain a set of documents to which a bidder develops a responsive proposal. Such solicitations typically come in three primary formats or types: Request for Quote (RFQ); Request for Proposal (RFP); and Invitation for Bid (IFB). Each of these solicitation types, as well as some of the key forms required by the government are discussed in the following slides. As a helpful activity, go to the government’s FBO website and download a sampling of RFQs, RFPs and IFBs -- to familiarize yourself with their overall organization and format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 28 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solicitation Numbers</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Solicitation numbers are important to understand.......</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To better understand the types of solicitations, let’s first look at the government’s numbering system. Each solicitation issued by the government is assigned a number. The number tells much about the solicitation. The first six digits identify the buying facility. The second two digits indicate the fiscal year the contract will be executed in. The alpha character defines the type of solicitation – which is both revealing and important. The R character – shown here -- indicates a request for proposal. The last four digits represent the order number. The alpha code is further explained in the next slide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slide 29 About the Alpha Character</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>R Request for Proposal</li>\r\n\t<li>M Purchase Order</li>\r\n\t<li>C Contract</li>\r\n\t<li>I Sealed bid</li>\r\n\t<li>\fJ Reserved</li>\r\n\t<li>T RFQ under $25k</li>\r\n\t<li>Q RFQ under $150k</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The alpha character or code used in the numbering system is important to understand. Different letters mean different things. For instance, R is for request for proposal, M is purchase order, C is contract of all types, I is for sealed bid, J is reserved, T is for a request for quote under $25K, and Q is for a request for quote under $150k. Slide 30</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Request for Quotation RFQRFQ is informational -- used by the government to obtain information and quotations</li>\r\n\t<li>Estimated value of the government’s need is expected to be under $150,000 and simplified acquisition procedures will apply</li>\r\n\t<li>RFQ may also be used in circumstances where simplified acquisition procedures are not used</li>\r\n\t<li>Bid package typically includes Standard Form 18 (SF18)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Request for Quotation or RFQ is the type of solicitation used by the government to obtain information and quotations, but the responses are not considered offers. This solicitation type is typically used when the estimated value of the government’s need is expected to be under $150,000 and simplified acquisition procedures will apply. An RFQ, however may also be used in some circumstances where the estimate value of the government’s need exceeds the simplified acquisition threshold. An RFQ bid package typically includes Standard Form 18.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 31 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Request for Proposal (RFQ)</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>RFP will result in a negotiated contract</li>\r\n\t<li>Proposals are often discussed and negotiated with government buying units and pricing, technical requirements and deliverables are subject to change</li>\r\n\t<li>Bid package typically includes Standard Form 33 (SF33) or Standard Form 1447 (SF1447)</li>\r\n\t<li>Electronic procurement systems, such as GSA’s eBuy – offer a fully electronic RFQ/RFP system</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Request for Proposals or RFPs are used in negotiated acquisitions to communicate government requirements to prospective contractors and to solicit proposals. RFPs for competitive acquisitions will, at a minimum, describe the government's requirements, anticipated terms and conditions that will apply, information required to be in the offeror's proposal, and factors that will be used to evaluate the proposal. An RFP will result in a negotiated contract. An RFP bid package typically includes Standard Form 33 or Standard Form 1447. It is important to note that some procurement systems, such as GSA’s eBuy – offer a fully electronic RFQ/RFP system. If you are unsure of any provision within an RFP -- ask the contracting officer for an explanation. Your BOS and PTAC counselors can also provide helpful guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>\fSlide 32 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Invitation for Bid (IFB)</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>IFB is often referred to as a sealed bid solicitation</li>\r\n\t<li>Price is key</li>\r\n\t<li>Bid package typically includes Standard Form 33 (SF33) or Standard Form 1447 (SF1447)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An Invitation for Bid or IFB is often referred to as a sealed bid solicitation. There are typically no discussions or negotiations with the government buying office and the bid package – when issued -- is considered complete for bidding purposes. Among qualified bidders, price is considered the key consideration by the government in awarding the contract. Responsiveness to the solicitation’s terms and conditions are key to a successful bid. Be sure to complete your bid package in accordance with the instructions. Non-responsive bids will be eliminated from consideration. An IFB bid package typically includes Standard Form 33 or Standard Form 1447.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 33 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Uniform Contract Format (Part I)</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Uniform contract format contains four parts</li>\r\n\t<li>Part I\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Section A – Solicitation/Contract Form (SF 33, SF26, SF18 or SF1447)</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Section B – List of supplies &amp; services to be acquired</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Section C – Outlines or explains the statement of work</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Section D – Describes packaging requirements</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Section E – Specifies inspection and acceptance</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Section F – Describes delivery and performance</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Section H – Outlines any special provisions</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For most RFPs and IFBs, where simplified acquisition procedures are NOT applied, the government requires the use of a uniform contract format. This format is described in the noted Far references and contains four parts and multiple sections. Part I contains section A which includes the use of Standard Form 33, Standard Form 26 or Standard Form 1447. In some circumstances it may also include SF 18 – which is a Request for Quotations. Sections B – H include a list of supplies and services to be acquired, the statement of work, packaging requirements, inspection and acceptance specifics, delivery and performance requirements, and any special provisions. Some of the provisions may only be incorporated by reference. However, you should go to the FAR to read those provisions to avoid any unpleasant surprises later on. Be sure you understand what you will be expected to do if you receive the contract award.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 34 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Uniform Contract Format (Parts II-IV)</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Part II\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Section I – Contract clauses</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Part III\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Section J – List of attachments</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Part IV\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Section K – Representations, certifications and other statements of offerors</li>\r\n\t\t<li>\f– Section L – Instructions, conditions and notices to offerors or respondents</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Section M – Evaluation factors and award</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part II, section I, contains the clauses required by law or the FAR that govern the specific contract. Part III, section J, contains a list of all attachments applicable to the contract. And, Part IV, sections K–M include information about representations and certifications – such as 8(a) certifications – required of offerors, instructions, conditions and notices to offerors, and importantly, section M outlines the evaluation factors that will be used to evaluate the award. It is important to note ----- contract solicitations for bids estimated to be below the simplified acquisition threshold or $150,000 will use a streamlined contract format and may or may not use some of the parts and sections outlined in the uniform contract format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 35 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A Closer Look at Standard Forms Solicitation and Contract Forms</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Standard Form 33, Solicitation, Offer and Award</li>\r\n\t<li>Standard Form 1449, Solicitation / Contract / Order for Commercial Items*</li>\r\n\t<li>Standard Form 1447, Solicitation / Contract*</li>\r\n\t<li>Standard Form 18, Request for Quotation*</li>\r\n\t<li>Standard Form 26, Award / Contract</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s take a closer look at the specific government standard forms and when they are used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 36</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Standard Form 33</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Standard Form 33, Solicitation, Offer and Award is the solicitation/contract form used by the federal government, not only to solicit orders, but also to award a contract</li>\r\n\t<li>Bilateral document – bidder signs the document and submits it to the government -- upon acceptance of the bid, the government signs the same document and a binding contract is established</li>\r\n\t<li>This form is used for either sealed bids or negotiated contracts valued at $150,000 or more</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Standard Form 33, Solicitation, Offer and Award is the solicitation/contract form used by the federal government, not only to solicit orders, but also to award a contract.

Writing the proposal, well that can make you even more anxious. It doesn’t have to be that way. Preparing a response to a government procurement request or invitation is an important task, not necessarily a daunting one. It should be approached with diligence and professionalism. Writing a successful proposal is about doing your homework, preparing and responding clearly and appropriately, aligning your proposal with the government’s needs and articulating what makes you the best solution provider. These elements are critical to successful proposal writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 42 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Carefully Review the Solicitation and Rules</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Preparation is key – you must be prepared...</li>\r\n\t<li>Carefully review the solicitation, including all applicable schedules, clauses, and attachments</li>\r\n\t<li>Review and understand the regulations (FAR Parts) governing the specific type of solicitation you plan to respond to</li>\r\n\t<li>Key Regulatory References</li>\r\n\t<li>FAR Part 13 – Simplified Acquisition Procedures</li>\r\n\t<li>FAR Part 14 – Sealed Bids</li>\r\n\t<li>FAR Part 15 – Contracts by Negotiation</li>\r\n\t<li>FAR Part 16 – Types of Contracts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Preparation is key... If you are going to respond to a government RFP or other type of procurement request, you must be prepared, or you will likely just be wasting your time. Carefully read the solicitation, including all applicable schedules, clauses and attachments. This is important. The solicitation is designed to provide prospective bidders with all of the information needed to write a successful proposal. The agency that prepared the solicitation expects you to read and follow it carefully. Also, make sure you review and understand the regulations (FAR Parts) governing the specific type of solicitation you plan to respond to. Some of the regulatory references relevant to the solicitation and proposal process are highlighted in this slide. If possible, assemble a team to review and prepare the proposal. Keep in mind, these are only some references. Other regulatory or policy guidance may be applicable to the specific procurement you are considering. Talk with your BOS, PTAC or a contracting officer for more assistance. Some PTACs and SBDCs offer training on how to prepare and submit proposals. Consider taking such training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slide 43</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prepare and Respond Appropriately</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Responding appropriately follows from reading and understanding the government’s request</li>\r\n\t<li>Answer all questions, provide all information and follow all schedules in the order, time- frame and structure requested</li>\r\n\t<li>This is important</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\fResponding appropriately to a solicitation follows from reading and understanding the government’s request. Solicitations are usually very specific and follow a uniform contract format. It is important that you respond, as you are asked – answering all questions, providing all information and following all schedules in the order, time-frame and structure requested. Eliminate any guesswork by ensuring that each response is appropriately identified so the reviewer can readily recognize the section of the RFP which is being addressed. This may sound like common sense and it is. But, you would be surprised to learn how many proposals submitted to the government that are received after the due-date and that do not respond to what was asked for, or requested. Responding appropriately is important!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 44 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Align the Proposal with the Government’s Needs</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Good proposal will clearly articulate how the bidder can solve the problem or fill the need outlined by the government</li>\r\n\t<li>Understanding the government’s request is important -- how your firm can execute or deliver an appropriate solution is critical</li>\r\n\t<li>A proposal may look good, but if it is not clearly aligned with fulfilling the government’s needs, it will fall behind other more substantive, solution focused proposals</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A good proposal will clearly articulate how the bidder can solve the problem or fill the need outlined in the government’s solicitation. This again, follows from understanding the nature of the procurement request. Understanding the government’s need is important. Even more important, however is how your firm plans to execute or deliver an appropriate solution. It is, after all about convincing a government review panel that your proposal solves a specific problem or need and is the best fit. A proposal may look good and read well, but if it is not clearly aligned with fulfilling the government’s needs, it will likely fall behind other more substantive, solution focused proposals. Don’t get caught up in telling a great story about your company, focusing too much on “we can do the work.” What really matters is substantiating how you can do the specific work that is needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 45 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Articulate What Makes You the Best Solution</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Key is pulling it all together in a proposal package that clearly describes why your company offers the best solution</li>\r\n\t<li>No magic bullet – it comes down to doing a lot of things right</li>\r\n\t<li>It’s about:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Understanding the solicitation and responding appropriately – Demonstrating how your firm can best fulfill the government’s needs – Offering pricing that is fair and competitive – Making sure your proposal is well-written and error free – Showing evidence of success through past performance – Interweaving an amazing story throughout all parts of the proposal that makes a compelling case for your firm as the best solution</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A typical government solicitation requires the bidder to provide a great deal of information. The key is pulling it all together in a proposal package that clearly describes why your company \foffers the best solution and is the best fit to perform the work. Think capture management....... There is no magic bullet. It comes down to doing a lot of things right. It’s about: understanding the solicitation and responding appropriately; clearly demonstrating how your firm can best fulfill the government’s need; offering pricing that is fair and competitive; making sure your proposal is well-written and error free; showing evidence of success through past performance; and finally, interweaving an amazing story throughout all parts of the proposal, including the executive summary – that makes a compelling case for your firm as the best solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 46 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>What to Avoid</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Failure to fully understand the solicitation and governing regulations</li>\r\n\t<li>Incomplete or late submission</li>\r\n\t<li>Proposal is not specific and to the point</li>\r\n\t<li>High on fluff and weak on substance</li>\r\n\t<li>Failure to understand best value considerations</li>\r\n\t<li>Unrealistic proposal pricing</li>\r\n\t<li>Evaluation components are not sufficiently addressed in the proposal</li>\r\n\t<li>Errors in the submission</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes learning from others provides the best lessons. With regards to solid proposal preparation, some key things to avoid include: not fully understanding the solicitation and governing regulations; submitting an incomplete or late submission; not providing specificity or focus; highlighting too much fluff and not enough substance, not understanding best value considerations; unrealistic pricing; failure to address evaluation factors; and errors in the submission. If you aren’t selected for a contract, consider asking for a debriefing to learn where you may have gone wrong and what you can do to improve your future proposals. Done in a professional manner, this can be a way to show contracting staff of your willingness to improve and to be more responsive to the government’s needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 47 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cost and Pricing</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 5, cost and pricing. This section is about considering contract costs and proposing a price to the government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 48 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Introduction to Contract Pricing</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Contract pricing is an important aspect of procurement and an important component in developing a strategy to win federal contracts</li>\r\n\t<li>COs are responsible for ensuring that agencies purchase supplies and services from responsible sources at fair and reasonable prices</li>\r\n\t<li>8(a) firm responsible for developing a contract pricing strategy that is reasonable, competitive, but profitable</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contract pricing is an important aspect of procurement and a particularly important component in developing a strategy to win federal contracts. There are two sides to this issue. \fFirst the government’s perspective. Federal contracting officers are responsible for ensuring that government agencies purchase supplies and services from responsible sources at fair and reasonable prices. As such and to accomplish this, most contracting officers and agency buyers conduct considerable market research to better understand markets and pricing. A contractor will likely have a related, but different perspective. An 8(a) firm, or any company for that matter wanting to do business with the government is responsible for developing a contract pricing strategy that is reasonable, competitive, but profitable. The typical contract bidder wants to make as much as possible in profit, but at the same time be competitive and win the bid. As such, with contracting officers doing considerable market research and a high number of firms competing for federal contracts, pricing is an important variable. A variable that can make or break your success in federal contract markets. A business must be aware of historical and current pricing trends, be thoughtful in its pricing analysis, competitive and able to make a profit --- if it wants to succeed in the federal contract space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 49 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Negotiated Contracts vs. Sealed Bid Contracts</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Two key types of contracts</li>\r\n\t<li>Any contract awarded using other than sealed bidding procedures is considered a negotiated contract</li>\r\n\t<li>Procedures for contracting by negotiation permit negotiations prior to contract award, but may or may not include negotiated discussions</li>\r\n\t<li>Pricing a proposal will likely be influenced by your ability to negotiate or not negotiate</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As discussed in the earlier section, proposal preparation, there are two fundamental contract categories: negotiated contracts and sealed bid contracts. The distinction between the two is important. The FAR states that any contract awarded using other than sealed bidding procedures is considered a negotiated contract. Procedures for contracting by sealed bidding require the government to evaluate bids without discussions and award to the responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the invitation for bids, will be most advantageous to the government considering only price and price related factors. Negotiations are not permitted prior to the contract award. Procedures for contracting by negotiation permit negotiations prior to contract award. However, a solicitation under procedures for contracting by negotiation may or may not actually include negotiations. For example, the instructions to offerors may include the provision, the “Government intends to evaluate proposals and award without discussions.\" When that provision is used, actual negotiations are not permitted unless the contracting officer determines in writing that they are necessary. The pricing you propose in response to a government solicitation will be influenced by your ability to negotiate or not negotiate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 50 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regulatory Guidance</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>FAR Part 15 – Negotiated Contracts – 15.101 Best value continuum – 15.4 Contract pricing – 15403 Obtaining cost or pricing data – 15.405 Price negotiation\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>\f– 15.407 Special cost or pricing data</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>FAR Part 14 – Sealed Bid Contracts\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>14.201-8 Price related factors – 14.3 Submission of bids – 14.408 Award – 14.408-2 Responsible bidder – Reasonableness of price</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>FAR Part 13 – Simplified Acquisition Procedures</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How you analyze your costs and price your proposal is primarily up to you, as long as you follow applicable government rules and guidelines. Federal rules for negotiated and sealed bid contracts and contracts that follow simplified acquisition procedures are outlined in FAR parts, 15, 14 and 13, respectively. Also, highlighted in the slide are FAR subparts that are pricing related. It is important to note, in addition to FAR guidance, other agency pricing guidelines or policies may also apply for specific contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 51 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pricing Approach</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Product Pricing (typical formula)\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Material Costs + Labor Costs + Overhead Expenses + Profit</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Service Pricing (typical formula)\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Hourly Overhead Expense + Hourly Wage + Profit</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pricing approach used by bidders for products and services being procured, besides following specific contract rules, is pretty typical, but unique to the business doing the pricing. That is, individual business costs and other considerations are factored into pricing formulas that are typical or generally used. For instance, with regards to product pricing, a firm would typically consider and add material costs, plus labor costs, plus estimated overhead expenses, plus a profit margin to arrive at a price it would propose or charge for the product being delivered. Regarding the pricing of a service, a firm would typically consider and add estimated hourly overhead expenses, plus hourly wages, plus a profit margin to arrive at a price it would propose or charge. It is important to point out, that some government solicitations and contracts are very unique regarding costs and pricing and specific cost and pricing requirements may apply. Carefully review all government requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 52 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Important Pricing Considerations</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Learn from past contracts -- review pricing history</li>\r\n\t<li>Consider all costs -- even special requirements</li>\r\n\t<li>Factor best value considerations</li>\r\n\t<li>Include bidding costs</li>\r\n\t<li>Allow for overhead and profit</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contract pricing is a critical component in developing a strategy to win federal contracts. A successful pricing strategy will: learn from past contracts; consider all costs -- even special \frequirements; factor best value considerations; include bidding costs; and, importantly allow for sufficient overhead expenses and profit. If a solicitation is using a ‘best value’ approach, the contracting officer may not make an award to the offeror providing the lowest price, rather an award will be made to that offeror who is providing the government with an approach that best meets the government’s needs. While price is always a consideration, in a best value scenario it doesn’t have to be the primary consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 53 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building Relationships</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 6, building relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 54 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building Relationships is Good Business</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Successful business people generally have a carefully developed and cultivated portfolio of relationships</li>\r\n\t<li>Building relationships is good business\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Network - Learn from the wisdom of others – Build a relationship with your BOS – SBA Mentor-Protégé Program / Other mentor-protégé programs</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Truly successful business people don’t necessarily have a mountain of contacts whose names they barely know and who are listed in some electronic file. Rather, they have a carefully developed and cultivated portfolio of relationships. Building solid relationships is good business. Remember, agencies don’t buy - people do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 55 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Network – Learn from the Wisdom of Others</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>A firm can waste a lot of time and expend unnecessary resources if it doesn’t understand how to play in the federal contracting arena</li>\r\n\t<li>Knowledge is everything</li>\r\n\t<li>Network and cultivate relationships with people experienced in the contracting space</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If there is one message that is consistent throughout this presentation, it is knowledge is everything. You don’t know what you don’t know. A business can waste a lot of time and expend unnecessary resources if it doesn’t understand how to play in the federal contracting arena. Learn from the wisdom of others. Others, who have seasoned knowledge and experience in federal contracting. Network, ask questions and cultivate relationships. Engage knowledgeable people who can help guide you through the challenging aspects of trying to win federal contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 56 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Build a Relationship with Your BOS</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>SBA assigned Business Opportunity Specialists help prospective and existing 8(a) firms benefit from the program</li>\r\n\t<li>Assist clients with eligibility and program requirements, planning , goals and business assistance</li>\r\n\t<li>Assist clients with government contracting programs and opportunities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\fOk.... so you have seen this slide before. That’s because it’s important! The SBA assigns each participating 8(a) firm with a Business Opportunity Specialist to help the firm benefit from the 8(a) program. BOSs are trained to help prospective and existing 8(a) firms with eligibility and program requirements, planning, goals and business assistance. They are also skilled in helping 8(a) firms benefit from government contracting programs and opportunities. It makes good business sense to create a strong working relationship with your BOS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 57 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA’s Mentor-Protégé Program</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Program offers significant benefits to participating 8(a) firms\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Technical and management assistance – Prime contracting – Financial assistance – Qualification for other SBA programs</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A very helpful program for participating 8(a) firms is SBA’s Mentor-Protégé Program. This relationship building initiative is designed to enhance the capability of 8(a) participants to compete more successfully for federal contracts. The program encourages 8(a) firms to partner with experienced contracting firms, serving as mentors. Under the program, 8(a) firms can gain significant benefits, including: technical and management assistance; prime contracting support; financial assistance in the form of equity or loans; and, qualification for other SBA programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 58 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technical and Management Assistance</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Technical and management assistance -- a mentor’s expertise, resources and capabilities may be made available to a protégé firm</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Technical and management assistance from a mentor can be a great help. Under the Mentor- Protégé Program, a mentor’s expertise, resources and capabilities may be made available to the 8(a) protégé firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 59 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prime Contracting</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Prime contracting -- mentors can enter into joint-venture arrangements with protégé firms to compete for government contracts</li>\r\n\t<li>Gives an 8(a) firm more leverage in bidding for contracts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the program, and this is huge, mentors can enter into joint-venture arrangements with protégé firms to compete for government contracts. This gives an 8(a) firm more leverage in bidding for contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 60 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Financial Assistance</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Financial assistance -- mentors can own an interest of up to 40% in a protégé firm to help it raise capital</li>\r\n\t<li>Key advantage</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\fAnother key advantage under the Mentor-Protégé Program is that mentors can own an interest of up to 40% in a protégé firm to help it raise capital. This too, can be very helpful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 61 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Qualification for Other SBA Programs</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Qualification for other SBA Programs -- protégé firm can obtain other forms of SBA assistance as a result of its good standing in the Mentor-Protégé Program</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, an 8(a) protégé firm can obtain other forms of SBA assistance as a result of its good standing in the Mentor-Protégé Program. It is important to point-out that other agencies also have mentor protégé programs that can be helpful to 8(a) firms. Building relationships through networking, business couches, SBA, partnerships or through mentor-protégé programs, represent an important dimension in winning contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 62 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Resources and Assistance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Part 7, resources and assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 63 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Resources and Tools</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Federal Acquisition Regulations\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>https://www.acquisition.gov/far</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Acquisition Central\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>https://www.acquisition.gov/</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>FAR Part 19 – Small Business Programs\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>http://www.acquisition.gov/far</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Code of Federal Regulations (13CFR)\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>http://www.gpoaccess.gov/cfr/index.html</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Federal Business Opportunities\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>http://www.fbo.gov</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>SBA-Government Contracting\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>http://www.sba.gov/aboutsba/sbaprograms/gc/index.html</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Numerous resources are available to assist individuals who are interested in learning more about and participating in the 8(a) Business Development Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 64 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Resources and Tools</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Learn more about:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>SAM Registration – http://www.sam.gov</li>\r\n\t\t<li>SBA Size Standards - http://www.sba.gov/category/navigation-structure/contracting/contracting-officials/eligibility-size-standards</li>\r\n\t\t<li>8(a) Business Development Program - http://www.sba.gov/content/8a-business-development-0</li>\r\n\t\t<li>WOSB Program - http://www.sba.gov/content/contracting-opportunities-women-owned-small-businesses – HUB Zone Program- http://www.sba.gov/content/hubzone-0</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>\fLocal (client) resources:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>SBA district office - http://www.sba.gov/localresources/index.html</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) - http://www.aptacus.org/new/Govt_Contracting/find.php</li>\r\n\t\t<li>SCORE chapter - http://www.score.org</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Small Business Development Center - http://www.asbdc-us.org</li>\r\n\t\t<li>Women’s Business Center - http://www.awbc.biz/locate.asp</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use these resources to become better informed and improve your chances of being a successful participant in the 8(a) program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 65 </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contact Us...</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Thank you for taking the time to learn about the 8(a) Business Development Program</li>\r\n\t<li>Please contact us with any questions you may have</li>\r\n\t<li>This is the third module in a four-part Pre-8(a) Business Development Program, training series U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Government Contracting and Business Development 800 U-ASK SBA</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about the 8(a) Business Development Program.

These benefits include:<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set asides - where as a contracting officer can reserve or set-aside specific contracts for qualified HUBZone firms;<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Government-wide contracting goals - such that at least 3% of all federal prime contracting dollars and 3% of all federal subcontracting dollars should flow to certified and qualified HUBZone firms;<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And, as the topic of this guide, the program features a price evaluation preference of 10% for the benefit of certified HUBZone firms in full and open competitive contract transactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 5 Price Evaluation Preference - Specifics</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Price evaluation preference is a key benefit for HUBZone firms and a powerful tool for contracting officers<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Shall only be applied in full and open competitive procurements<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;PEP can not be used:<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;where price is not a contract evaluation factor<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;for acquisitions where \"all fair and reasonable offers are accepted\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The price evaluation preference is a key benefit for qualified HUBZone firms. It is also a powerful tool for contracting officers to reach HUBZone contracting goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, however, it shall only be used by contracting officers in acquisitions using full and open competition. Further, the preference CAN NOT be used: (1) in acquisitions where price is not an evaluation factor and (2) in the award of multiple award contracts, buying schedules or in circumstances where all fair and reasonable offers are accepted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 6 Calculating the Evaluation Preference</strong><br />\r\n&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In full and open competitions, a contracting officer must deem the price offered by a qualified HUBZone firm to be lower than the price offered by another offeror - other than another small business - if the price offered by the qualified HUBZone firm is not more than 10% higher than the otherwise lowest, responsive and responsible offeror<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Circumstances involving a \"best value\" procurement -- the price evaluation preference may still apply<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;HUBZone Help Desk 202 205-8885 ---- hubzone@sba.gov Narrative<br />\r\nAgain, the 10% price evaluation preference can only be applied in full and open competitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is how it works. A qualified HUBZone firm can win a competitive procurement even if its bid is up to 10% higher than an equally qualified large firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A contracting officer must deem the price offered by a qualified HUBZone firm to be lower than the price offered by another offeror - other than another small business - if the price offered by the qualified HUBZone firm is not more than 10% higher than the otherwise lowest, responsive and responsible offeror. In other words, the price offered by a qualified HUBZone firm can be as much as 10% higher than the price offered by a qualified large business or non-small business and still win the competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In circumstances involving a \"best value\" procurement, the price evaluation preference may still apply. That is, in a situation where a qualified HUBZone firm is competing with qualified large firms, the 10% price adjustment -- to benefit of the HUBZone firm -- would be made and the contracting officer would then determine which offeror represents the best value to the government, in accordance with the terms of the solicitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider the following examples and GAO case. Slide 7 Example 1…<br />\r\nFACTS: In a full and open competition, a qualified HUBZone firm submits an offer of $100, a non-<br />\r\nHUBZone small business submits and offer of $97, and a large business submits an offer of $95. It appears the lowest, responsive, responsible offeror would be the large business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OUTCOME:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The contracting officer must apply the price evaluation preference. &nbsp;As such, the HUBZone offer of $100 is not more than 10% higher than the $95 offer of the large business. Therefore, the qualified HUBZone firm displaces the large business as the lowest, responsive, and responsible offeror.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nExample 1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a full and open competition, a qualified HUBZone firm submits an offer of $100, a non-HUBZone small business submits and offer of $97, and a large business submits an offer of $95. It appears the lowest, responsive, responsible offeror would be the large business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, because this procurement involves a qualified HUBZone firm and is a full and open competition, the contracting officer must apply the price evaluation preference. As such, the HUBZone offer of $100 is not more than 10% higher than the $95 offer of the large business. Therefore, the qualified HUBZone firm displaces the large business as the lowest, responsive, and responsible offeror.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 8 Example 2…</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>FACTS: In a full and open competition, a qualified HUBZone firm submits an offer of $103, a non- HUBZone small business submits and offer of $100, and a large business submits an offer of $93. The lowest, responsive, responsible offeror would be the large business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OUTCOME:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The contracting officer must apply the price evaluation preference. &nbsp;As such, the HUBZone offer of $103 is more than 10% higher than the $93 offer from the large business. Therefore, the qualified HUBZone firm does not displace the large business as the lowest, responsive, and responsible offeror. In addition, the non-HUBZone small firm with its offer of $100, does not displace the large business because a price evaluation preference is not applied to benefit a non-HUBZone small business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative Example 2.<br />\r\nIn a full and open competition, a qualified HUBZone firm submits an offer of $103, a non-HUBZone small business submits and offer of $100, and a large business submits an offer of $93. &nbsp;The lowest, responsive, responsible offeror would be the large business.<br />\r\nAgain, in this case, because a qualified HUBZone firm is involved in a fully competitive acquisition, the contracting officer must apply the price evaluation preference. As such, the HUBZone firm offer of $103 is more than 10% higher than the $93 offer from the large business. Therefore, the qualified HUBZone firm does not displace the large business as the lowest, responsive, and responsible offeror. In addition, the non-HUBZone small firm with its offer of $100, does not displace the large business because a price evaluation preference is not applied to benefit a non-HUBZone small business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 9 Example 3…</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>FACTS: In a full and open competition, a qualified HUBZone firm submits an offer of $98 and a non- HUBZone small business submits and offer of $93.<br />\r\nOUTCOME:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The contracting officer would not apply the price evaluation preference in this procurement because the lowest, responsive, and responsible offeror is a small business.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nNarrative Example 3.<br />\r\nIn a full and open competition, a qualified HUBZone firm submits an offer of $98 and a non-HUBZone small business submits and offer of $93.<br />\r\nIn this case, the contracting officer would not apply the price evaluation preference because the lowest, responsive, and responsible offeror is a small business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 10 GAO Case: Explo Systems, Inc.

It recommended that the agency apply the HUBZone price evaluation preference in accordance with the applicable FAR provisions and that it perform a new \"best value\" tradeoff decision.<br />\r\nIt also recommended that the protester be reimbursed reasonable costs for filing and pursuing its protest.<br />\r\n<strong>Slide 11 Department of Agriculture Purchases</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Price evaluation preference is different for commodity purchases made by the Secretary of Agriculture<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;10% for the portion of a contract to be awarded that is not greater than 25% of the volume being procured for each commodity in a single IFB<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5% for the portion of a contract to be awarded that is not greater than 25%, but not greater than 40% of the total volume being procured for each commodity in a single IFB<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0% for the portion of a contract that is greater than 40% of the total volume being procured for each commodity in a single IFB<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;HUBZone Help Desk 202 205-8885 ---- hubzone@sba.gov</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For purchases made by the Department of Agriculture, for agricultural commodities, the price evaluation preference is different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is, for specific agricultural products, the HUBZone price evaluation preference is as follows: (a) 10% for the portion of a contract to be awarded that is not greater than 25% of the volume being procured for each commodity in a single invitation for bids; 5% for the portion of a contract to be awarded that is not greater than 25%, but not greater than 40% of the total volume being procured for each commodity in a single invitation for bids; and, zero percent for the portion of a contract that is greater than 40% of the total volume being procured for each commodity in a single invitation for bid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 10% and 5% price evaluation preferences for agricultural products apply to all offers from qualified HUBZone firms up to the 25% and 40% volume limits just described. As such, more than one qualified HUBZone firm may receive a price evaluation preference for any given commodity in a single IFB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 12 Agricultural Exports</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For purchases made by the Department of Agriculture for export</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;price evaluation preference is 5% on the first portion of a contract to be awarded that is not greater than 20% of the total volume being procured for each commodity in a single IFB</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For purchases made by the Department of Agriculture for export -- through the international food aid programs administrated by the Farm Service Agency -- the price evaluation preference is 5% on the first portion of a contract to be awarded that is not greater than 20% of the total volume being procured for each commodity in a single IFB.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 13 Waiver of Price Evaluation Preference</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>HUBZone small business may elect to waive the price evaluation preference</li>\r\n\t<li>Certain \"limitations on subcontracting\" would not apply</li>\r\n\t<li>Review FAR 52.219-4(c) Narrative</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A HUBZone small business may elect to waive the price evaluation preference, in which case the 10% pricing factor would be added to its offer for evaluation purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In such cases, certain limitations on subcontracting would not apply.

It provides a brief discussion about federal disaster assistance, identifies statutory, regulatory and other emergency acquisition guidance, highlights the importance of small business and describes emergency acquisition strategies outlined in the FAR and other sources available to contracting officers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 4 Federal Response - Disaster Assistance</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Emergencies are not predictable and can happen at any time<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Federal government plays a significant role in normalizing emergencies and supporting disaster recoveries<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;FEMA typically assumes the lead role when disaster declarations are declared at the federal level<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SBA plays a major role in federal and other declared emergencies through its disaster and small business programs<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nEmergencies are not predictable and can happen at any time. &nbsp;The federal government, in cooperation with state and local governments, plays a significant role in normalizing such emergencies and supporting disaster recoveries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FEMA typically assumes the lead role when disaster declarations are declared at the federal level. In this role, FEMA coordinates with other federal partners, state and local governments and the private sector to procure life-sustaining goods and services for disaster victims. In state emergency disaster declarations, the federal government typically assumes a support role and works closely with state and local governments.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA also plays a major role in federal and other declared emergencies through its disaster assistance and small business programs. For instance, SBA is currently supporting victims of Hurricane Sandy and other disasters with loan, contracting, disaster and counseling programs.<br />\r\nOther federal agencies also play very supportive roles in disaster assistance, as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 5 Statutory, Regulatory and Executive Guidance</strong><br />\r\n- Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act<br />\r\n- FAR Part 18<br />\r\n- FAR Subpart 26.2<br />\r\n- OFPP guidance - emergency acquisitions<br />\r\n- Other guidance<br />\r\n- Executive Orders<br />\r\n- Specific Statutes</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary guidance for emergency acquisitions is outlined in the Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, FAR Part 18, FAR Subpart 26.2 and an OFPP guide, updated in 2011 for emergency acquisitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other guidance is also available in Executive Orders, such as the recent order creating the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force and specific statutes, such as The Sandy Recovery Improvement Act of 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 6 Importance of Small Business in Disaster Assistance</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Small firms are the backbone of the economy, providing jobs, innovation and competition<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Local small business can provide a quick and flexible, \"boots on the ground\" response in a disaster environment and can return disaster funds back to the community<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Stafford Act sets the tone by requiring preferences and set-asides for local small firms But first, a statement about the importance of small business, specifically local small firms.<br />\r\nSmall firms are the backbone of the economy providing jobs, innovation and competition. Local small firms can also provide a quick and flexible response in a disaster environment and can return disaster funds back to the community by providing known and localized employment opportunities and local spending.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Stafford Act sets the tone, regarding local and small firms. The law requires that \"agencies must perform market research on local business capabilities and give preference to those local firms capable of performing the requirement\". &nbsp;In addition, the amended statute adds a local firm set-aside requirement for<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\ndebris clearance, distribution of supplies, reconstruction and other major disaster or emergency area assistance activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FAR, OFPP and other policy guidance specifically require that federal agencies provide maximum contracting opportunities for small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 7 Key Small Business Programs</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;8(a) Business Development Program (see 19.8)<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;HUBZone Program (see 19.3)<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Women Owned Small Business Program (WOSB) (see 19.15)<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Veterans Programs (SDVOSB/VOSB) (see 19.14 for SDVOSB)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are a number of programs specific to small business that can assist contracting officers with procuring disaster related goods and services. These programs include the 8(a) Business Development Program, the HUBZone Program, Women Owned Small Business Program and Veterans programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, the 8(a), HUBZone and the Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Program all authorize agencies to acquire goods and services from qualified program participants on a sole source (and competitive) basis. This authority enables agencies to identify and rapidly enter into contracts with capable small business sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 8 Acquisition Strategies Acquisition Strategies.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 9 Acquisition Strategies</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;FAR Subpart 18.1 Available Acquisition Flexibilities<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;FAR Subpart 18.2 Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities Subpart 18.201 Contingency Operation<br />\r\nSubpart 18.202 Defense or Recovery from Certain Attacks<br />\r\nSubpart 18.203 Emergency Declaration or Major Disaster Declarations Subpart 18.204 Resources<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;FAR Subpart 26.2 Disaster or Emergency Assistance Activities<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;General OFPP Guidance &amp; Executive Orders</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Emergency acquisition procedures for all federal agencies are primarily defined in the Stafford Act, FAR Part 18 - Emergency Acquisitions, FAR Subpart 26.2 - Disaster or Emergency Assistance Activities and selected OFPP policy guidance and Executive Orders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The FAR provides many methods and flexibilities for contracting officers to quickly acquire emergency- related goods and services, even if an emergency declaration has not been declared. The FAR also outlines additional streamlined methods that may only be used after an emergency declaration is made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, FAR Part 18 is divided into two main sections, Subpart 18.1, Available Acquisition Flexibilities, which may be used anytime and does not require an emergency declaration and Subpart 18.2, Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities, which may only be used after an emergency declaration or designation has been declared. &nbsp;Subpart 18.2 is further divided into four sub-categories, Contingency<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nOperation, Defense or Recovery from Certain Attacks, Emergency Declaration or Major Disaster Declarations and Resources.<br />\r\nFAR Subpart 26.2 specifically implements the Stafford Act and provides a clear preference for local organizations, firms and individuals when contracting for major disaster or emergency assistance activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the Office of Federal Procurement Policy published the Emergency Acquisition Guide, updated in 2011 to assist the contracting community with planning and executing emergency acquisition contracts. &nbsp;Each of these FAR parts and OFPP guide is discussed in the following.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 10 FAR Subpart 18.1</strong><br />\r\nFAR Subpart 18.1.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 11 FAR Subpart 18.1 Available Acquisition Strategies</strong><br />\r\n- Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act<br />\r\n- FAR Subpart 18.1 Available Acquisition Flexibilities<br />\r\n- FAR Subpart 18.2 Emergency Acquisition Flexibilities<br />\r\n- Subpart 18.201 Contingency Operation<br />\r\n- Subpart 18.202 Defense or Recovery from Certain Attacks<br />\r\n- Subpart 18.203 Emergency Declaration or Major Disaster Declarations<br />\r\n- Subpart 18.204 Resources<br />\r\n- FAR Subpart 26.2 Disaster or Emergency Assistance Activities<br />\r\n- General OFPP Guidance &amp; Executive Orders</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FAR Part 18 is more of a menu of available flexible acquisition rules than anything else. It directs the contracting community to where existing emergency procedures are located elsewhere in the FAR.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Subpart 18.1, Available Acquisition Procedures, outlines rules and provisions that are available to contracting officers when certain emergency conditions are met. Again, the use of these procedural flexibilities does not require an emergency declaration or designation of contingency operation. This is an important point.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Key provisions in this subpart include: contractors are not required to register in the System for Award Management for contracts awarded to support unusual or compelling needs or emergency acquisitions; contracting officers are not required to provide a synopsis notice when there is an unusual and compelling urgency; and agencies may also limit the number of sources it considers and full and open competition is not required in actions involving urgent requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to note, although this subpart suggests that a firm does not have to register in SAM, the practical side is that any firm that wants to be listed in the Disaster Response Registry must be registered in SAM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 12 FAR Subpart 18.1 (cont)</strong><br />\r\n- 18.105 -- FSS, BPA's and Multi-Agency Indefinite Delivery Contracts<br />\r\n- Streamlined procedures and a broad range of goods and services may be available under Federal Supply Schedules, multi-agency blanket purchase agreements and multi-agency indefinite delivery contracts (see 8.4, 8.405-3 &amp;

Preference may be given through local area set-asides or an evaluation preference.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding set-asides, the contracting officer may set aside solicitations to allow only local firms within a specific geographic area to compete. The set-aside area need not include all the counties in the declared disaster or emergency areas, but cannot go outside it. The contracting officer shall also determine whether a local area set-aside should be further restricted to small business concerns in the set-aside area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the contracting officer may use an evaluation preference, when authorized in agency regulations or procedures to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 25 Transition of Work</strong><br />\r\n- Agencies involved in response planning should consider awarding emergency response contracts before a major disaster occurs to ensure immediate response and relief<br />\r\n- Such contracts should not be structured in any way that may inhibit the transition of emergency response work to local firms<br />\r\n- Agencies shall transition work to local firms as soon as Presidential emergency declaration is made<br />\r\n- Agencies can transition work using the local area set-asides authorized in this subpart This provision further emphasizes the use of local small firms.<br />\r\nIt brings attention to agencies involved in disaster assistance planning and disaster assistance support. It directs that such agencies consider awarding emergency response contracts before a major disaster or emergency occurs to ensure immediate response and relief. These contracts should be structured to respond to immediate emergency response needs, and should not be structured in any way that may inhibit the transition of emergency response work to local firms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Agencies are encouraged to transition work using the local area set-asides authorized in this subpart</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Slide 26 Justification for Expenditure</strong><br />\r\n- Any expenditure of federal funds, under an emergency response contract not awarded to a local firm, subsequent to an emergency declaration, must be justified in writing</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Following a Presidential declaration of a major disaster or emergency, this provision requires that any expenditure of federal funds, under an emergency response contract not awarded to a local firm, must be justified in writing and made part of the contract file.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The justification should include consideration for the scope of the major disaster or emergency and the immediate requirements or needs of supplies and services to be acquired.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the justification may be made on an individual or class basis and the contracting officer can approve the justification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Slide 27 Disaster Response Registry</strong><br />\r\n- CO's required to consult the Disaster Response Registry in SAM to determine the availability of contractors for debris removal, distribution of supplies, reconstruction, and other disaster or emergency relief activities<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nRequired also in this subpart is the requirement that contracting officers consult the Disaster Response Registry - in the System for Award Management -- to determine the availability of contractors for debris removal, distribution of supplies, reconstruction, and other disaster or emergency relief activities within the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 28 Solicitation and Contract Clauses</strong><br />\r\n- Key provisions and clauses are required<br />\r\n- Insert provision at 52.226-3, Disaster or Emergency Area Representation, solicitations involving local area set-asides<br />\r\n- Insert the clause at 52.226.4, Notice of Disaster or Emergency Area Set-aside in solicitations and contracts involving local area set-asides<br />\r\n- Insert the clause at 52.226.5, Restrictions on Subcontracting Outside Disaster or Emergency Area in contracts involving local area set-asides</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, this subpart requires contracting officers to insert key solicitation provisions and contract clauses in solicitations and contracts involving local area set-asides and certain other circumstances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 29 General OFPP Guidance &amp; Executive Orders</strong><br />\r\n- Office of Federal Procurement Policy in cooperation with the Emergency Response &amp; Recovery Working Group prepared the Emergency Acquisition Guide<br />\r\n- Supplements FAR Parts 18 and 26 and the National Response Framework document<br />\r\n- Assists CO's with planning and executing emergency acquisitions</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OFPP in cooperation with the Emergency Response &amp; Recovery Working Group prepared the Emergency Acquisition Guide, which was updated in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The guide is designed to supplement FAR Parts 18 and 26 and the National Response Framework document, published by FEMA.

They define the maximum size a business can be, together with its affiliates, to qualify for federal small business programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 3 Course Contents</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This training module describes what size standards are, how they are established, why they are important, how they are used, where to find them and how to determine if a specific business concern - or your business - is considered a small business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also describes what is meant by affiliation and how such affiliations can impact the size of a business.<br />\r\nSlide 4 Statutory and Regulatory Authority</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The foundation for size standards is established in the Small Business Act. This provision of law defines a small business as one that \"is independently owned and operated and which is not dominant in its field of operation.\" The law also requires that the definition of a small business vary from industry to industry to the extent necessary to reflect industry differences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Small Business Act gives the SBA the authority to establish small business size standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regulations specifying small business size standards and governing their use are in Title 13, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 121. SBA's size regulations pertaining to procurement are also found in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, or the FAR at 48 CFR Part 19.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 5 Understanding Size Standards</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topic Divide -- Understanding size standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 6 What is a Business Concern?</strong><br />\r\nBefore a business can qualify as a small business, it must satisfy the requirement that it is a business concern. &nbsp;This is important and foundational in understanding size standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What is a business concern? &nbsp;A business concern means that the entity is organized for-profit; has a physical place of business in the United States; and, operates primarily in the United States. If it does not operate primarily in the United States, it must make a significant contribution to the U. S. economy by paying taxes or using American products, materials, or labor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Entities that do not meet the definition of a business concern, regardless of how small they are, cannot qualify as a small business concern for federal programs. That however, would not preclude them from contracting with the government or applying for grants and the like. It would, however, disqualify them from competing against small business concerns for contracts or benefits when being a small business is required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 7 Simply Put: What are Size Standards?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok… So what are size standards?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simply put, size standards define whether a business entity is small and, thus, eligible for federal programs and preferences reserved for small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Size standards are established by industry, generally as defined under the North American Industry Classification System - more commonly known as NAICS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The North American Industry Classification System classifies business establishments for the purpose of collecting, analyzing, and publishing statistical data related to the U.S. economy. The NAICS industry codes define establishments based on the activities in which they are primarily engaged. &nbsp;SBA uses NAICS as a basis for establishing size standards.<br />\r\nSlide 8 Historical Perspective: Defining a Small Business From an historical perspective…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Small Business Act created the Small Business Administration - SBA, to aid, counsel and assist small businesses.<br />\r\nSBA uses its authority, also stated in the ACT to establish small business size standards, industry by industry. Size standards are usually stated in either the number of employees or average annual receipts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Size standards are often used to establish eligibility for federal government programs reserved for small businesses. There may be other requirements, depending on the particular program, but being small for all of them is the first step and the size standards apply to them uniformly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 9 General -- Size Standards by Industry</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Two common size standards cover most, but not all industries. The first, a small business for most manufacturing and mining industries is defined as having 500 or fewer employees. The second, a small business for most nonmanufacturing industries is one that does not exceed $7.5 million in average annual receipts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To determine the applicable size standard, use the referenced SBA size standards tool or review the agency's table of small business size standards, or the noted regulatory link.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 10 Specific -- Size Standards by Industry Sector</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA uses the 6-digit NAICS industry codes in multiple 2-digit NAICS sectors in determining size standards. &nbsp;Many of the key sectors are highlighted in the slide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, again and importantly, use SBA's size standards tool, the agency's table of small business size standards, the summary of size standards by industry sector, or the referenced CFR link to find the specific size standard, within a certain industry sector.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 11 Establishing Size Standards</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topic Divide -- Establishing size standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 12 Establishing Size Standards: Methodology</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The methodology for establishing size standards is very transparent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA provides on its website a detailed explanation of size standards methodology that it applies in determining size standards. The methodology is outlined in a white paper that is available to the public. Review the whitepaper at your convenience for greater clarity about how size standards are established.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 13 Using Size Standards</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topic Divide -- Using size standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 14 Size Standards: Calculating Receipts</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calculating receipts…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A company's \"receipts\" are based on its most recently completed fiscal three years. \"Receipts\" are equal to the company's \"total income\" (or in the case of a sole proprietorship, \"gross income\") plus \"cost of goods sold\" as these terms are defined and reported on Internal Revenue Service tax return forms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Receipts do not include: net capital gains or losses; taxes collected for and remitted to a taxing authority; proceeds from transactions between a concern and its affiliates; and amounts collected for another by a travel agent, real estate agent, advertising agent, conference management service provider, freight forwarder or customs broker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 15 Size Standards: Calculating Number of Employees</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Calculating the number of employees…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A business concern's number of employees is the average number of people employed for each pay period over its latest 12 calendar months. Any person on the payroll must be included as one employee regardless of hours worked or their temporary status. That is, it is the \"head count,\" not \"full time equivalents.\" This number includes the employees of all affiliates, regardless of what they do, where they are located, or how the affiliates are organized (such as nonprofit or for profit).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number of employees of a concern in business for less than 12 months is simply the average for each pay period that it has been in business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 16 Using Size Standards: Government Procurement Programs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Size standards play an important role in determining eligibility for government programs, especially federal procurement, SBA's loan assistance, and innovation research programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Size standards are used to determine eligibility for many small business programs, including Small Business Set-asides, 8(a) Business Development, Women Owned Small Businesses, Economically Disadvantaged Women Owned Small Businesses, HUBZone, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Businesses, and other small business programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Links to multiple small business programs are profiled in the resource section of this course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 17 Using Size Standards: Qualifying as \"Small\"</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Qualifying as small for government procurement programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company must meet the size standard for the procurement. It is important to note, therefore, that the designated NAICS code may or may not be the same as the company's \"primary\" NAICS code. However, if the business meets the size standard for the designated NAICS code, then it is still eligible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In determining if it meets that size standard, remember, as we discussed earlier, the company must include all of its annual receipts and number of employees, together with those of its affiliates, in determining if it qualifies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is not unusual, for a company with multiple capabilities, to qualify as small for one or more NAICS codes and not for others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 18 Using Size Standards: Other SBA Programs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other SBA programs providing financial assistance.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSize standards also play an important role in determining eligibility for SBA financial assistance programs, such as its 7(a) loan program through local financial institutions, and other lending organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SBA's \"Small Business Innovation Research\" and \"Small Business Technology Transfer\" Programs promote federal small business high technology to improve the competitive capability of small research and development businesses. The emphasis is on emerging and under served small firms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Links to these and other small business programs are in the resource section of this course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 19 Federal Procurement: Using Size Standards</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Procurement…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each year, small businesses benefit from about $80 billion in federal prime contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To bid on a federal contract - as a small business - a firm must self-certify that it is, in-fact a small business under the appropriate size standard in the solicitation. The firm does this by registering in the System for Award Management (SAM) at www.sam.gov. The size of the business at the time of self-certification is what the SBA considers to prevail for the contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In both the 8(a) business development and HUBZone programs, a participating firm must first meet the size standard for its primary industry as required in the program - then, it must meet the size standard for the NAICS code assigned to each individual contract on which it is bidding, even if that size standard is lower than the one for its primary industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 20 SBA Loan Assistance Programs: Using Size Standards</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Loan assistance…<br />\r\nTo qualify for SBA business loan assistance, a business applicant must meet the size standard for the industry in which it, including its affiliates, is primarily engaged in, as well as the size standard for its primary industry, without including its affiliates. SBA will determine if the business is an eligible small business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business applicants for financial assistance under SBA's Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) and Community Development Company (504) programs, must meet the size standard for business loan assistance - just described or, as an alternative, not exceed net worth and net income limits of $19.5 million and $6.5 million, respectively for the SBIC program and $15 million and $5 million, respectively for the 7(a) and 504 programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 21 SBA Loan Assistance (cont)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For assistance under SBA's surety bond assistance program, a business, combined with its affiliates, must meet the size standard for the primary industry in which such business, combined with its affiliates, is engaged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For assistance under SBA's Economic Injury Disaster Loan Program, a business must meet the applicable size standard described in 13 CFR 121.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 22 Innovation Research: Using Size Standards</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Innovation research…<br />\r\nSBA's Small Business Innovation Research Program and the Small Business Technology Transfer program more commonly known as the SBIR and STTR programs provide small businesses with a competitive opportunity to propose innovations to help solve the research and development needs of the federal government.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To participate in this program, a small business must be either: at least 51 percent owned and controlled by US citizens or lawfully admitted permanent resident aliens, and, including affiliates, not exceed 500 employees; or, at least 51% owned and controlled by another business concern that is itself at least 51% owned and controlled by individuals who are citizens of, or permanent resident aliens in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 23 Innovation Research: Using Size Standards (cont)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, in determining an SBIR firm's size, you must include the employees of all of its affiliates, wherever they are, and whether they are for-profit or not-for-profit entities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many SBIR participants and applicants for participation have one or more venture capital investors. This is an important issue, because determining the SBIR company's eligibility as a small business involves counting the employees of all of its affiliates. SBA has provided further explanation in its \"Affiliation Discussion\", with examples, of affiliation relationships, and how a company could be affected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA's affiliation regulations can be found at 13 C.F.R. 121.702.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 24 Finding Size Standards</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topic Divide -- Finding size standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 25 Finding Size Standards</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Size standards applicable to your business or other businesses can be easily determined by using SBA's size standards tool, referring to the table of small business size standards, or by reviewing the regulatory provision at 13 CFR 121.201. These links have been noted several times throughout this presentation because of their importance.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Slide 26 NAICS Codes: Finding Size Standards</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok… so we have talked a lot about size standards: what they are, how they are applied, why they are important and how to find them. &nbsp;However, it is important to understand that size standards are based on NAICS industries. Therefore, it is foundational to understand how to determine NAICS codes and to understand what NAICS codes are applicable to your business, or what NAICS codes are applicable to other businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 27 Understanding Affiliation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topic Divide -- Understanding affiliation. Slide 28 Affiliation<br />\r\nBusiness affiliation is an important aspect of size standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In determining if a firm qualifies as a small business, SBA uses and evaluates the firm's annual receipts, number of employees and/or any foreign or domestic affiliations the firm may have.<br />\r\nSBA's guidelines on affiliation can be found at 13 CFR 121.103.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally, affiliation exists when one or more individuals or businesses controls or has the power to control another or when a third party controls or has the power to control both businesses. Control may arise through ownership, management, or other relationships or interactions between the parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, control may be affirmative or negative. Negative control includes instances where a minority shareholder has the ability, under the firm's charter, by-laws, or shareholder's agreement, to prevent a quorum or otherwise block action by the board of directors or shareholders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 29 Affiliation -- General Principals</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>General principals of affiliation are highlighted in the following slides. Such general rules regarding affiliation are described in terms of stock ownership, stock options, common management, identity of interest, contractual relationships, newly organized businesses, joint ventures and franchise agreements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 30 Affiliation and Investors</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, some firms may have outside investors, such as a venture capital company, hedge fund, or private equity firm and their affiliation can impact eligibility for small business size status.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 31 Stock Ownership: Affiliation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding stock ownership…<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nAn entity is an affiliate of a business if the entity owns or controls, or has the power to control, 50 percent or more of the firm's voting stock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A business also is affiliated with an entity who owns and controls, or has the power to control, a block of voting stock that is large compared to all other outstanding blocks of stock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further, if two or more entities own or control, or have the power to control less than 50 percent of a firm's voting stock and (1) the minority holdings are all approximately equal in size and (2) all of the minority holdings taken together are large compared to any other stock holdings, affiliation is presumed to exist with each of those entities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, when a firm's voting stock is widely held and no single block of stock is large as compared with all other stock holdings, the business concern's Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) or President are deemed to have the power to control the concern unless evidence is provided to show otherwise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 32 Stock Options, Convertible Securities…</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Affiliation Stock options, convertible securities and agreements to merge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA treats stock options, convertible securities, and agreements to merge as though the rights granted have been actually exercised. In other words, SBA assumes present effect regarding an agreement to merge or to sell stock, even if it is only an agreement in principle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If such rights have been granted or expressed, and they confer the power to control, affiliation exists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 33 Common Management: Affiliation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Common management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If one or more officers, directors, managing members, or general partners of a business controls the Board of Directors and/or the management of another business, both firms are affiliates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 34 Identity of Interest: Affiliation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Identity of interest between individuals or businesses, including family members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Individuals or firms that have identical or substantially identical business or economic interests may be treated as one party unless they can demonstrate otherwise. Family members, persons with common investments, or firms that are economically dependent through contractual or other relationships, are among those treated this way by the SBA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, individuals or firms may seek to demonstrate that no affiliation exists by providing evidence establishing that apparently identical interests are, in fact, separate.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<strong>Slide 35 Contractual Relationships - Dependency: Affiliation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contractual relationships or economic dependency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A firm that is economically dependent upon another business will likely be found to be affiliated with the other business or businesses it is dependent upon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 36 Newly Organized Concerns: Affiliation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Newly organized concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A new business that is organized by the former officers, directors, principal stockholders, managing members, or key employees of another concern may be considered affiliated with the older business concern, if the older concern furnishes the new business with contracts, financial or technical assistance, indemnification, or other facilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such an apparent affiliation may be rebutted by demonstrating to the SBA that there is a clear line of fracture between the two businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 37 Joint Ventures: Affiliation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joint ventures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A joint venture is an association of individuals and/or business concerns for the purpose of combining efforts, property, money, skill, or knowledge, but not on a continuing or permanent basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA may determine that the relationship between a prime contractor and its subcontractor is a joint venture, and that affiliation between the two exists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 38 Franchises and License Agreements: Affiliation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Franchises and license agreements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Generally speaking, restraints imposed on a franchisee or licensee by its franchise or license agreement relating to standardized quality, advertising, accounting format and other similar provisions, generally will not be considered in determining whether the franchisor or licensor is affiliated with the franchisee or licensee. However, affiliation may be evident through other means, such as common ownership, common management or excessive restrictions upon the sale of the franchise interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 39 Size Protests and NAICS Code Appeals Topic Divide</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>-- Size protests and NAICS code appeals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 40 Size Protests and Certificates of Competenc</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, so we have covered a lot of ground concerning the importance, methodology and use of size standards. &nbsp;Another important element is size protests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we discussed earlier, in most cases a business self-certifies that it meets the standards of being small. In situations involving government contracts, the contracting officer determines or validates the size of a business based on standards in the CFR or the Table of Small Business Size Standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some cases, another firm or interested party may protest the size status of the winning bidder or low offeror. In such cases, the contracting officer will forward the size protest to SBA's Area Office of Government Contracting --- that is responsible for the region where the protested firm's headquarters is located.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only certain parties or individuals can make a size protest. They include: the unsuccessful offeror, the contracting officer, an SBA Government Contracting Area Office, other interested parties, or other government officials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA's Certificate of Competency Program allows a small business to appeal a contracting officer's determination that it cannot fulfill the requirements of a specific government contract on which it is the apparent low bidder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 41 Size Determination</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA, through its appropriate area office, makes a formal size determination after a size protest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Such protests are typically addressed by the agency within ten days of receiving the formal protest. Formal size determinations made by the area office may be appealed to the Office of Hearings and Appeals at SBA headquarters in Washington, D.C., by any of the interested parties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use the referenced links to learn more about how to file a protest or to appeal a size determination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 42 Appeals of Size Determinations and NAICS Designations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make an appeal to SBA's Office of Hearings and Appeals, the appeal petition must be in writing.<br />\r\nA size appeal must be served and filed within 15 calendar days after the receipt of the formal size determination. &nbsp;An untimely appeal will be dismissed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Office of Hearings and Appeals will review the appeal and issue its decision containing the facts and the basis for its conclusion. It will notify all parties involved in writing . This will be the final decision of the SBA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 43 Resources and Tool</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Topic Divide -- Resources and tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 44 Resources and Tools</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Numerous resources are available to assist individuals who are interested in learning more about size standards and federal contracting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 45 Resources and Tools</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use these resources to become better informed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 46 Contact Us…</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about small business size standards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much information has been discussed and we hope it is helpful.

Visit the resource icon in the course player or locate additional tools, templates, and mentors on SBA.gov once you finish the course.<br />\r\nLet's get started!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How Is a Strategic Plan Different from Any Other Plan?</strong><br />\r\nCreating a strategic plan involves establishing a strategy your business will follow over a set period of time. It can be specific to one area or generalized for the business as a whole. For example, your plan may address only your marketing strategy. A strategic plan is not a business plan. Business plans are typically for new businesses, particularly those seeking investors. A business plan makes an argument for the viability and need of your business; it does not establish a long-term direction for your business. Strategic planning should establish goals and action plans for growing your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Importance and Purpose of Strategic Planning</strong><br />\r\nThere is nothing more important than establishing goals for your business, and strategic planning is a good vehicle for doing so; however, it can be a waste of time if not done properly. Strategic planning must be viewed as a tool and not a goal. Often, businesses spend time crafting complex strategic plans that do little to establish a clearly stated direction for their employees. A strategic plan should not consume your valuable time and resources. Rather, a strategic plan should help streamline business practices and boost employee productivity. Strategic planning enables you to take control of your future and provide a workable framework for expanding your business intelligently. Ideally, a strategic plan will provide long-term clarity and focus. Strategic plans are not just for big businesses. Small businesses can benefit tremendously, boosting their productivity, expanding their markets, and becoming more significant contenders in their industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Benefits of Strategic Planning</strong><br />\r\nSome of the benefits associated with creating a strategic plan include:<br />\r\n- Control costs<br />\r\n- Increase margins<br />\r\n- Facilitate growth<br />\r\n- Position to survive economic downturns<br />\r\n- Determine if needed resources are available<br />\r\n- Compete in a competitive marketplace<br />\r\n- Impress investors<br />\r\n- Keep lenders apprised of development<br />\r\n- Use as tool to sell, merge, or buy a business<br />\r\n- Facilitate formation of strategic alliances<br />\r\n- Recruitment tool for key executives<br />\r\n- Use in public relations and marketplace credibility<br />\r\n- Use as the basis of a business plan</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.7&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Overview of Strategic Planning</strong><br />\r\nA good strategic planning process is one through which leaders define and implement a strategy to achieve the company's goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The output of a strategic planning session includes:<br />\r\n- High-level objectives (such as critical improvement areas)<br />\r\n- Initiatives (action plans for achieving objectives)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every employee should know the strategy and his or her place and role therein. A strategic plan should be a living document, revised at regular intervals, depending upon the changes in your industry. The strategic planning process should be open and flexible. It should encourage new ideas and be designed to challenge assumptions and the status quo and be communicated to all staff members and key stakeholders. Therefore, additional benefits of strategic planning include:<br />\r\n- Improves communication<br />\r\n- Increases knowledge of company and market<br />\r\n- Cultivates teamwork</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.8&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Stakeholders</strong><br />\r\nStakeholders in the strategic planning process include:<br />\r\n- CEO<br />\r\n- Board members or key investors<br />\r\n- Key managers<br />\r\n- Admin assistant for notes and details Expectations of stakeholders include:<br />\r\n- Commitment<br />\r\n- Information<br />\r\n- Communication<br />\r\n- Time<br />\r\n- Continuity<br />\r\n- Honesty</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.9&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Pre-Work</strong><br />\r\nThere are a few tasks that should be addressed before beginning the strategic planning process.<br />\r\n- Begin with a situation analysis in which you establish a basis for action. Ask, \"Where are we now? How can we quantify that position? Where are our competitors? How can we quantify that position?\"<br />\r\n- You should also establish clear and consistent focus for the strategic planning meeting. This could include a list of objectives, a clear agenda, a schedule, and expectations for included stakeholders.<br />\r\n- You must have a platform for involvement of team members. If all of your stakeholders are centrally-located, then this should be as simple as gathering in a conference room or office. If your stakeholders are not centrally-located, then you will have to consider other options such as teleconferencing, video-teleconferencing, or virtual meeting solutions.<br />\r\n- Similar to the platform for involvement is a method of communication. How will team members communicate with each other? Once again, co-location can simplify this problem; however, you will want a record of important conversations and decisions.<br />\r\n- Lastly, before you begin, you should establish success criteria. What do you expect your strategic plan to look like? How will it be documented and communicated?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.10&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Components of the Strategic Plan</strong><br />\r\nThere are several components of a good strategic plan.<br />\r\n- The first component is a business purpose, vision, or mission statement. This statement should sum up the essence of what you are trying to achieve as a company.<br />\r\n- The second component is organizational goals or objectives. These are the ends to which your efforts are aimed.<br />\r\n- The third component is strategies for reaching your goals. What approach will you take to meet the goal? This part changes frequently if a strategy is not helping you meet your goal and should include built-in checkpoints for re-evaluation.<br />\r\n- The fourth component is actions to implement strategies. This will include specific, measurable activities.<br />\r\n- The last component is a monitoring plan. It is important to remember that follow-through is imperative for a successful strategic plan. You should include benchmarks, checkpoints, and milestones in your monitoring plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.11&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Strategic Planning Process</strong><br />\r\nNow let's discuss the actual strategic planning process. As you work through the process, remember to include opportunities for review and iteration. The strategic planning process may take a while in total, primarily through testing for viability. You want to make sure that the goals you have set and the plans you have established for reaching them are plausible and that other stakeholders in your business are willing to work toward them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.12&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Purpose, Vision, or Mission</strong><br />\r\nThe first step in the strategic planning process is reviewing or creating a purpose, vision, or mission statement. This is a good opportunity to revisit your statement and make sure it still aligns with your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.13&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Establish a Focus</strong><br />\r\nThe next step is to determine the focus of the plan based on critical needs. Use the situation analysis from your pre-work. Where is your business now? Where does it need to be?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.14&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Develop Key Objectives</strong><br />\r\nDevelop key objectives to reach over 1-3 years. One way to establish these goals is through an open brainstorming session. Nothing is irrelevant, but everything can be streamlined and organized later. Ask yourself, \"Do we have it? Do we really want it?\" Then, preserve, eliminate, avoid, or decide to achieve each item depending on the answers to those questions. Select the \"Objectives\" puzzle piece to learn more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.15&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Key objectives</strong><br />\r\nPossible areas for your objectives include:<br />\r\n- Leadership development<br />\r\n- Process improvement<br />\r\n- Market development<br />\r\n- Product/service development</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.16&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SWOT Analysis</strong><br />\r\nWhen establishing objectives, you should use SWOT analysis to provide clarity and focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don't be intimidated by the technical-sounding term. Preparing a SWOT analysis is actually very simple. The acronym just stands for \"Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats.\" The idea behind this exercise is to describe your company's strategic position in those four areas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are the greatest strengths and weaknesses of your company? Where do you see your most promising opportunities? What competitive threats do you need to avoid or overcome to take advantage of those opportunities?<br />\r\nStart your SWOT analysis by describing the strongest aspects of your business. What do you do best? What unique or enviable resources do you have that give you a competitive advantage?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understanding your strengths will enable you to focus on them so you can maximize your advantages over your competitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Describe your company's shortcomings as clearly and honestly as you can. Don't be embarrassed about this. Every business has weak points, and acknowledging yours is not a sign of weakness itself but a signal that you are committed to improvement. Think about the missing ingredients that threaten to keep your business from reaching its full potential. Weak areas need to be identified and shored up, not glossed over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now shift your focus outward from your company to the market and customer base that you serve. What opportunities do you see just waiting for the right company to come along?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finish your SWOT analysis by identifying the major outside threats to your business. What challenges do you face? What potential threats are keeping you up at night? The better you are at identifying threats, the better positioned you will be to respond to them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.17&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Establish Key Indicators</strong><br />\r\nNext, create key indicators to measure progress toward objectives. These will actually be quantifiable. For example, \"Increase Internet sales by 10%.\" If your plan does not help you achieve this goal, then it needs to be revised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.18&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Identify Initiatives</strong><br />\r\nAfter you have established key indicators, you will need to identify initiatives that will enable the organization to meet the objectives. How will you achieve your goal? What tasks need to be completed and by whom?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.19&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Communicate Your Plan</strong><br />\r\nAfter you have completed your plan, you will need to communicate the plan throughout the organization. This is a very important piece of the process. If you do not have buy-in from all people involved, your plan will not get far; after all, you will be depending on others to help implement the plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.20&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Review and Adjust</strong><br />\r\nYou will need to conduct periodic reviews to ensure that initiatives are progressing as expected and determine whether they are achieving objectives. This is where your milestones come in.<br />\r\nYou should have an idea of the pace at which you will progress toward achieving your goals, and you should ensure that the pace is maintained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take action when necessary to get back on track. If you find that your pace has not been maintained, figure out how you can get back on track. The longevity of your plan depends on monitoring and maintaining the plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.21&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Documentation</strong><br />\r\nAfter you go through the process of developing a strategic plan, you should document it in a streamlined fashion for easy reference and distribution. This can be achieved through a simple document in which you:<br />\r\n- State your purpose, vision, or mission<br />\r\n- State key objectives or goals<br />\r\n- State initiatives through which your objectives or goals will be achieved<br />\r\n- State performance indicators for each objective or goal.<br />\r\nA table format, a simple narrative, or a more in-depth document can all serve this purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.22&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Course Summary</strong><br />\r\nThat was a lot of information about some relatively complex concepts. Let's review.<br />\r\n- Strategic planning is different from other types of planning because it helps you establish a goal for the future and an action plan for achieving that goal. For example, strategic planning is different from business planning because it is an iterative process that you refine continuously rather than a plan you create at a specific phase of your business.<br />\r\n- Strategic planning is important because it enables you to set a direction for your business, either in an overall sense or within a specific area.<br />\r\n- Before you begin your strategic plan, you should complete an analysis to benchmark your current status, establish a focus for your strategic plan, establish a platform for participation, establish a method of communication, and define success criteria.<br />\r\n- When you are ready to begin your strategic plan, start with a mission statement, re-visit your plan's focus, establish objectives for your plan, identify quantifiable indicators of success, identify initiatives for achieving your objectives, communicate your plan to others in your business, periodically review your plan, and take action when necessary to get your plan back on track.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.23&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Next Steps</strong><br />\r\nNow what should you do?

It is a practical, self-paced course packed with business information as well as real-world examples and helpful tips.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The course is intended to be a guide for small businesses to help determine if exporting – as a business strategy – makes sense and whether the basic ingredients for export readiness are in-place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a powerful trend that is reshaping the American economy, a growing number of U.S. small firms are selling hundreds of billions of dollars in products and services to markets all over the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You will find the course easy to follow and the subject matter indexed for quick reference and easy access. It will take about 30 minutes to complete. Additional time will be needed to review included resource materials and to complete the suggested next steps at the end of the course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you complete the program, you will have the option of receiving a printed Certificate of Completion from the SBA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 3: SBA Exporter of the Year</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many small U.S. firms have found profitable niche markets overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2009 SBA Exporter of the Year, Andrew Krause, cofounder of SOUTHWEST WINDPOWER, credits the company’s start in exporting to help from the SBA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 4: SBA Exporter of the Year</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many small U.S. firms have found profitable niche markets overseas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 2009 SBA Exporter of the Year, Andrew Krause, cofounder of SOUTHWEST WINDPOWER, credits the company’s start in exporting to help from the SBA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 5: Course Objectives</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This program has four key objectives:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Define the value of globalization and help determine a firm’s readiness for exporting.</li>\r\n\t<li>Provide practical guidance on how to research international markets and make business connections throughout the world.</li>\r\n\t<li>Describe how to develop an export strategy, receive and make international payments, and finance trade operations.</li>\r\n\t<li>Identify and provide direct access to key international trade resources.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 6: Expanding World Markets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Did you know that over 95 percent of the world’s population lives outside of the United States. That means, if you have a product or service to sell, you may want to go where the buyers are and, increasingly, that’s outside of the United States.&nbsp; Going global is real!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>New technologies, advanced communications and improved travel and delivery options are making the world – as we know it – smaller. Today, via the Internet, we can communicate across the globe in an instant. We have access to information and markets all over the world, making it relatively easy to identify new opportunities and increase sales in foreign markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is critical for small U.S. businesses to think globally. You may have already discovered that your company is competing internationally because foreign-owned companies are competing with you in&nbsp; your “domestic” markets. The line between domestic and international markets is becoming increasingly blurred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a world of over 6 billion people, global communication networks, next-day---world-wide deliveries and international television, it no longer makes sense to limit your company’s sales to local or even national markets. Your business cannot ignore international influences and opportunities, if you intend to maintain your market share and keep pace with your competitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exporting is crucial to America’s economic health. Increased exports mean business growth, and business growth means bigger profits for U.S. companies—all of which ultimately result in more jobs for American workers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 7: Is Exporting for You?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many advantages to exporting. However, international trade is not for everyone. You may be interested, but your business may not be suited or ready for exporting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several ways to evaluate the export potential of your products and services in foreign markets. The most common approach is to examine the success of your products domestically. If your company is successful selling in the U.S. market, then there is a good chance that it will also be successful in international markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 8: Export Readiness</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help gauge your export readiness, think about and respond honestly to the following questions: Is exporting consistent with the vision and mission of your company?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does your company have products and services that are successfully sold in domestic markets? Why will your products be successful in international markets?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you have the commitment, persistence and financial resources to actively support the marketing of your products in targeted international markets?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Discussing and answering these questions with a mentor or international trade advisor will help define your readiness for exporting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 9: Readiness Assessment Tool</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>At your convenience, come back to this page and use this automated assessment tool to determine your readiness for exporting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This nine question tool was developed by the Foreign Agriculture Service.&nbsp; It’s well done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After answering the questions you will receive a score that will help you evaluate your export readiness, as well as identify areas your business needs to improve its export capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 10: Preparing for Global Markets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>OK, let’s get started…..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Success in business often depends on how well you prepare yourself and your business --- but, you know that already. If you are already in business, you know things just don’t fall into place, without proper research and planning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is no different in the world of exporting….To successfully penetrate international markets, you need to understand them. There are many ways you can research global markets. Several proven methods include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep abreast of world events that influence the international marketplace, watch for announcements of specific projects, or talk with foreign buyers at U.S. trade shows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Go to industry roundtables, lunches or briefings. Talk to suppliers, bankers, colleagues and trade professionals like shippers, or other successful exporters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your existing network is probably a good starting point. But get advice from trade experts and experienced exporters. Contact the trade specialists at the U. S. Department of Commerce, your state’s economic development department, local or regional trade associations, or you could hire an international trade consultant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 11: Screen Potential Markets</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Market research is key. Once you have completed your basic due diligence – further analyze or screen potential markets.&nbsp; Consider following these steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 1. Obtain export statistics that describe the volume of product exports to various countries. Published export statistics provide a reliable indicator of where U.S. exports are currently being shipped. The U.S. Census Bureau provides these statistics in a published format. Check with a trade expert or mentor to help find this information.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 2. Identify five to ten large and fast-growing markets for your company’s product. Review them over the past three to five years to determine if market growth has been consistent. Be cautious of markets where growth is inconsistent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 3. Identify some smaller but fast-emerging markets that may provide ground-floor opportunities. If the market is just beginning to open up, there may be fewer competitors than in established markets. And,</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 4. Target identified and promising markets and consult with trade mentors and experts to help further evaluate such markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep in mind, that there is a wealth of online country and market information available to help you screen potential markets. Powerful resources such as export.gov, the Commerce Department and others can be very helpful and are highlighted later in this program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 12: Develop an Export Strategy</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>OK -- so you’ve done your research and are now ready to develop an export strategy. You have two basic choices, selling directly or indirectly to foreign markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indirect selling is a common approach, especially for small businesses just entering international markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the indirect approach, a business can engage an intermediary such as an export management company or export trading company to sell products in foreign markets. Indirect selling is a popular choice for American firms, especially small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Direct selling to international customers is the most ambitious yet the most difficult approach because you are working directly with foreign entities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 13: Indirect Selling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Indirect selling, through intermediaries, is the easiest way to enter international markets. Export Management Companies and Export Trading Companies are, such intermediaries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Export Management Companies act as your “off-site” export department, representing your product— along with the products of other companies—to prospective overseas buyers. The export management company looks for business on behalf of your company and takes care of all aspects of the export transaction. Hiring an EMC is often a viable option for smaller companies that lack the time and expertise to break into international markets on their own. Some specific functions EMCs perform include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Conducting market research to determine the best foreign markets for your products;</li>\r\n\t<li>Attending trade shows and promoting your products overseas;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Assessing proper distribution channels;</li>\r\n\t<li>Locating international representatives and/or distributors; and,</li>\r\n\t<li>Arranging export financing, and, handling export logistics, and advising on the legal aspects of exporting and other compliance matters.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Export Trading Companies do many of the same functions, but also take title to the product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 14: Direct Selling</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Direct selling means that you are responsible for finding international buyers for your products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is, once you have identified international markets offering the most potential, you will need to find ways to enter them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some proven methods include:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Advertise in periodicals. Many small businesses report that foreign buyers often find THEM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An ad placed in a trade journal or in the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Commercial News USA can be a low-cost method for testing market interest and often yields inquiries from abroad. Commercial News USA is a monthly export catalog-magazine promoting U.S. products and services through U.S. embassies and overseas trade organizations in more than 150 countries, at a fraction of the cost of any other advertising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. Commercial Service offers a number of programs to help locate potential agents or distributors overseas for your products, including the Gold Key service and the International Partner search, by utilizing its worldwide network of offices located in U.S. Embassies and consulates abroad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trade shows are another means of locating foreign buyers. The U.S. Commercial Service’s International Buyer Program brings thousands of international buyers annually to meet with U.S. companies at major trade shows in the United States.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Participating in overseas trade missions is yet another way to meet foreign buyers. Public/private trade missions are often organized cooperatively by federal and state international trade agencies and trade associations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 15: Methods of International Payments</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In any business, getting paid in full and on time is critical. It’s no different with exporting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several ways in which you can receive payment when selling your products&nbsp; internationally. However, your selected method will likely depend on how trustworthy you consider your buyer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Typically with domestic sales, the transactions are made via credit or cash. With export sales, different payment methods such as cash in advance, letters of credit, documentary collections or open account are the most often used. These methods of payment can seem more complicated to new exporters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An experienced exporting firm extends credit cautiously. It evaluates new customers with care and continuously monitors older accounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of the payment methods is explained in the following sections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 16: Cash In Advance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cash in advance is often the first choice for payment and offers the least amount of risk to the exporter. As such, the exporting business is relieved of collection problems and has immediate use of the money. A wire transfer is the best method and has the advantage of being almost immediate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Payment by check should not be used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many exporting businesses accept credit cards in payment for exports of low dollar value that are sold directly to the end user. Domestic and international rules governing credit card transactions differ. With the increase in fraudulent use of credit cards, there can be no, or limited, protection against loss resulting from the use of unauthorized or stolen cards.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 17: Letters of Credit</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Letters of credit, called LCs, are one of the most common and safest payment methods available. An export letter of credit is an internationally recognized instrument issued by a bank on behalf of its client, the buyer. Of course, the buyer pays its bank a fee for this service. As a result, some buyers will resist LC terms if the competition is offering more lenient or less expensive terms. Keep in mind that various payment methods can be used as marketing tools and therefore should be negotiated carefully by you and the buyer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A letter of credit is useful if you are unsure of a prospective buyer’s credit worthiness, but are satisfied with the credit worthiness of your buyer’s bank. Sometimes it is difficult to obtain reliable credit information about a foreign buyer, but it may be less difficult to do so for the buyer’s bank. Moreover, this vehicle can be structured to protect the buyer since no payment obligation arises until the goods have been satisfactorily shipped or delivered as promised.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The terms and conditions required for payment under a letter of credit are spelled out in it. When the terms and conditions have been met, as verified through the presentation of all required documents, the buyer’s bank makes the required payment directly to the seller’s bank in accordance with the terms of payment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 18: Documentary Collections</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As in the use of Letters of Credit, documents are presented and passed from bank to bank to trigger payment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Documentary Collection, however, does not have the payment guaranty from the bank that is inherent in a Letter of Credit. The bank functions here more in a ‘courier’ role and will hold the documents until the buyer makes payment or accepts the bill of exchange; then the documents are surrendered and the buyer can clear the goods through customs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cash against documents involves a sight draft that is paid on presentation. Documents against acceptance requires the buyer to accept the accompanying bill of exchange or draft.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be aware that on air freight this arrangement may not work as cleanly as with ocean freight, where there is a bill of lading that functions as legal title to the goods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 19: Open Account</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a foreign transaction, an open account can be a convenient method of payment if the buyer is well established, has a long and favorable payment record, or has been thoroughly checked for creditworthiness. With an open account, the exporter simply bills the customer, who is expected to pay under agreed terms at a future date. Some of the largest foreign firms make purchases only on open account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, there are risks to open account sales. The absence of documents and banking channels might make it difficult to pursue the legal enforcement of claims. The exporter also might have to pursue collection abroad, which can be difficult and costly. Another problem is that receivables may be harder to finance, since drafts or other evidence of indebtedness are unavailable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is advisable to combine open account terms with credit risk insurance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 20: Export Financing</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raising needed capital is not always easy. This is especially true for small businesses interested in obtaining working capital for export purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given the difficulty many small businesses encounter when looking for export financing, it is imperative that any financial arrangements be made well in advance. To find a lender willing to consider your request, you must ensure that the purpose of the loan makes sense for the business, that the request is for a reasonable amount, and that you can clearly demonstrate how the loan will be repaid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this said, and in the spirit of good preparation, SBA has prepared several training modules which may be beneficial to you. They can be reviewed at your convenience and include: How to Prepare a Business Plan; the Finance Primer: A Guide to SBA’s Loan Guaranty Programs and How to Prepare a Loan Package. Similar to this training program, they are self-paced and will take about 30 minutes to complete. Also, the Department of Commerce has prepared an excellent trade finance guide.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 21: Private Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with any good business decision, it pays to do your homework and to shop around. This goes for financing your business as well. Typically, export financing is obtained from private or government sources.&nbsp; In this and the following sections, we will discuss both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We will begin with the private sector. Commercial banks are a major source of export financing, as are private export finance companies. Export management and trading companies may also provide financing for a fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another commercial source is factoring. Factoring houses or “factors” purchase export receivables on a discounted basis, providing exporters immediate payment on shipment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, it pays to consider all options and to do your homework. Specifically with financing, sit-down with an export mentor, banker or SBA trade representative to review and consider private and government finance options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 22: Government Financing Sources</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because private sector financing providers will typically only assume limited risk regarding foreign transactions, the U.S. government provides export financing assistance. Such assistance generally comes in the form of guarantees made to U.S. commercial banks, which in turn make loans available to exporters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some federal agencies, such as the SBA or the Export-Import Bank, as well as some state governments, have their own specific export financing programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 23: SBA – Financing Programs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA offers multiple and diverse programs to support the export financing needs of small businesses.&nbsp; Some of SBA’s programs work in conjunction with EX-IM Bank.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA’s most popular financing program is the 7(a) Loan Guaranty Program. The agency also offers three targeted special purpose loan programs, specifically geared for small businesses interested in exporting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 24: Basic 7(a) Loan Guaranty Program</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>7(a) loans are the most basic and most popular of SBA's business loan programs. Its name comes from section 7(a) of the Small Business Act, which authorizes the Agency to provide business loans to American small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All 7(a) loans are provided by lenders who are called participants because they participate with SBA in the 7(a) program. Not all lenders choose to participate, but most American banks do. There are also some non-bank lenders who participate with SBA in the 7(a) program which expands the availability of lenders making loans under SBA guidelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7(a) loans are only available on a guaranty basis. This means they are provided by lenders who choose to structure their own loans by SBA's requirements and who apply and receive a guaranty from SBA on a portion of this loan. The SBA does not fully guaranty 7(a) loans. The lender and SBA share the risk that a borrower will not be able to repay the loan in full. The guaranty is a guaranty against payment default. It does not cover imprudent decisions by the lender or misrepresentation by the borrower.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the guaranty concept, commercial lenders make and administer the loans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 25: SBA Export-Express</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The SBA Export Express program provides exporters and lenders a streamlined method to obtain SBA backed financing for loans and lines of credit up to $250,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By allowing lenders to use their own credit decision process and loan documentation, exporters get access to their funds faster. SBA provides an expedited eligibility review and provides a response in less than 24 hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Export Express program helps small businesses develop or expand their export markets. Loan proceeds may be used to finance any export development activity, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Standby Letters of Credit; Participation in a foreign trade shows;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Translation of product brochures or catalogues; General lines of credit for export purposes;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Purchase of real estate and equipment to be used in the production of goods or services for export And, other export financing needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 26: Export Working Capital Program</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA’s Export Working Capital Program—or “EWCP”-- targets businesses that are able to generate export sales and need additional working capital to support these transactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These EWCP loans can be used to support 100% of supplier, or production, costs for an export transaction. They can also be used to even-out cash flow when exporters have negotiated longer sales terms and cannot carry the resulting receivables with their own working capital.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The export working capital loans can be short-term, for example, for a single contract or for in the form of a revolving line of credit, supporting ongoing export sales for a period of 12 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA’s EWCP loans ensure that qualified small business exporters do not lose viable export sales due to a lack of working capital. For this reason, SBA provides incentives to banks through loan guarantees so that they will make export loans to companies who would otherwise not be bankable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 27: International Trade Loan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA’s International Trade Loan Program features term loans designed for businesses that plan to start or continue exporting or those that that have been adversely affected by competition from imports. The proceeds of this SBA loan program must enable the borrower to be in a better position to compete.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 28: Export-Import Bank</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Export-Import Bank, more commonly known as EX-IM Bank, is an independent government agency that supports the financing of U.S. goods and services, turning export opportunities into real transactions and maintaining and creating more U.S. jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It assumes the credit and country risks that the private sector is unable or unwilling to accept. It does not compete with private sector lenders, but provides export-financing products that fill gaps in trade financing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also helps to level the playing field for U.S. exporters by providing export credit insurance and guarantees on loans made to foreign buyers purchasing U.S. capital goods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>EX-IM Bank provides a variety of financial assistance. Use the hyperlink to learn more about the EX-IM bank and its small business programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 29: Legal Considerations</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the complex arena of international markets, it is best to seek the advice of qualified professionals. You should start with examining what legal protections are important, needed and affordable for your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trade specialists at the U.S. Export Assistance Center nearest you are a first step in checking on the need, timing, protection value and procedures for guarding against theft of intellectual property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The U.S. Export Legal Assistance Network—or ELAN--is a cooperative effort by the Federal Bar Association, the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Small Business Administration. Under this agreement, ELAN offers small businesses a one time, free legal consultation with knowledgeable attorneys who have expertise in international trade. To set up an appointment, contact your nearest Export Assistance Center.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 30: Shipping and Distribution</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s assume for a moment that you have customers, who are providing you with purchase orders or contracts for export sales, ------ you will need to negotiate with them the terms of sale, for example, how and when to ship;&nbsp; and how and when to get paid, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When negotiating an international sales contract, both parties need to pay as much attention to the terms of sale as to the sales price. To make it as clear as possible, an international set of trade terms (INCO terms) has been adopted by most countries. INCO terms—13 options in all--are an international convention of terms for defining who pays for shipment, insurance and import duties. The same terms also record the transfer of ownership while the goods are in transit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The INCO term in your sales agreement will guide the freight forwarder or logistics firm which you have hired in handling the goods and the charges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For smaller transactions and air freight, there are also other options for you to select as shippers, i.e., FEDEX, UPS, DHL, etc. They often have small business departments to handle both shipping arrangements and the required documents that need to accompany the products to their destination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A final comment on licensing. For some sensitive product categories, i.e., high technology items and weapons, the U.S. government requires a license before it is legal to export them. Usually this is done through the Bureau of Industry and Security, but in some cases the State Department also must grant its approval.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more about this critical part of getting export shipments to the buyer, review some of the training videos provided by the US Census Bureau.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 31: Next Steps</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much material has been discussed in this course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The instructional part of the program is complete. It is now up to you to apply what you have learned.&nbsp; This is the most important part of the course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are serious about exporting, consider taking the next steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 1. To expand your orientation about exporting, spend at least a couple of hours at your leisure reviewing the Web resources included at the end of this training module. All of those included are rich in content and excellent sources of information.&nbsp; Export.gov is particularly good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 2. Discuss what you learned from this course and any questions you have with a business mentor, export counselor or SBA trade representative. Also, consider signing up for additional export training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step 3. Revise your business plan, making adjustments for the addition of an export component to your business.&nbsp; Include specific information and research about potential foreign markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slide 32: Export Development Assistance</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many exciting, new opportunities for exporting. Specifically, opportunities are arising in countries such as China, India, Brazil, and others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many resources are available to assist you in exporting to these countries and to places all over the world.&nbsp; The following resources can help you build a foundation of knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA has 68 district offices located throughout the country to help you start and grow your business.

HUBZone areas are typically areas of low median household incomes or high unemployment, or both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At any given time, there are some 5,000 small firms certified in the HUBZone program. Slide 3 Program Purpose<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Provides federal contracting assistance to qualified small firms in designated HUBZones to:<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Increase employment opportunities<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Stimulate capital investment<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Empower communities through economic leveraging</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative<br />\r\nImportantly, the HUBZone program helps small businesses in urban and rural communities.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nIt provides federal contracting assistance to qualified small firms located in historically underutilized business zones -- or HUBZones -- to increase employment opportunities, stimulate capital investment in those areas, and empower communities through economic leveraging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 4 How the Program Works</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SBA regulates and implements the HUBZone program<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Determines which businesses are eligible<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Maintains a listing of qualified HUBZone firms to fulfill procurement opportunities<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Adjudicates protests of eligibility regarding HUBZone contracts</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative<br />\r\nThe U.S. Small Business Administration regulates and implements the HUBZone program. As such, SBA determines which businesses are eligible for the program, maintains a listing of qualified HUBZone small businesses that can be used by federal agencies to fulfill procurement needs and adjudicates protests of eligibility regarding HUBZone contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 5 Key Program Benefits</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Contract set-asides<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3% government-wide prime and subcontracting goals<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;10% price evaluation preference HUBZone Help Desk… HUBZone@sba.gov</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative<br />\r\nThe program offers significant benefits to certified HUBZone firms. &nbsp;These benefits include:<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Set asides - that is contracting officers can reserve or set-aside specific contracts for qualified HUBZone firms;<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Government-wide contracting goals have also been established requiring that at least 3% of all federal prime contracting dollars and 3% of all federal subcontracting dollars flow to certified and qualified HUBZone firms;<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In addition, a price evaluation preference of 10% can be applied to certified HUBZone firms in full and open contract competitions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 6 Eligibility Requirements</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Small business (by SBA standards)<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Owned and controlled by at least 51% U.S. citizens or a community development corporation, an agricultural cooperative, or an Indian tribe<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Principal office must be located within a designated HUBZone<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At least 35% of its employees must reside in a HUBZone<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Note: Different rules apply for Tribal Governments, Alaska Native Corporations, Community Development Corporations and small agricultural cooperatives. These are delineated in Title 13 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 126 - http://www.sba.gov/about-sba- services/7591/13775<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative<br />\r\nTo be eligible for the HUBZone program a business must meet the following criteria:<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;aIt must be a small business by SBA standards;<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It must be directly owned and controlled by at least 51% U.S. citizens or a community development corporation, an agricultural cooperative, or an Indian tribe;<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Its principal office must be located within a designated HUBZone, which includes lands considered \"Indian country\" and military facilities closed by the Base Realignment and Closure Act; and,<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At least 35% of its employees must reside in a HUBZone.<br />\r\nThere are different rules for concerns owned by Tribal Governments, Alaska Native Corporations, Community Development Corporations and small agricultural cooperatives. These are delineated in Title 13 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 126.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 7 Eligibility Requirements - Ownership by Individuals</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Business must be directly and unconditionally owned and controlled by at least 51% U.S. citizens<br />\r\n- - - 13 CFR 126.200(b) (1)(i)<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Citizen means a person born or naturalized in the United States. SBA does not consider holders of permanent visas and resident aliens to be citizens - - - 13 CFR 126.103<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Person means a natural person - - - 13 CFR 126.103</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative<br />\r\nA business must be directly and unconditionally owned and controlled by at least 51% U.S. citizens. Consider this example:<br />\r\nBetty Smith is the 100% owner of ABC Inc. - a corporation. ABC owns 100% of XYZ - a limited liability corporation. &nbsp;The XYZ company applies for HUBZone certification.<br />\r\nThe application is denied -- because XYZ a limited liability corporation is not directly and unconditionally owned and controlled by at least 51% U.S. citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 8 Eligibility Requirements - Principal Office</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Principal office must be located within a designated HUBZone<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Principal office means the location where the greatest number of the concern's employees at any one location perform their work - - - 13 CFR 126.103<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;For concerns whose \"primary industry\" is service or construction, the determination of principal office excludes the concern's employees who perform the majority of their work at job-site locations to fulfill specific contract obligations - - - 13 CFR 126.103</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative<br />\r\nA principal office must be located within a designated HUBZone. &nbsp;Consider this example:<br />\r\nA janitorial firm has 100 employees. &nbsp;Ninety five of them work at job sites. &nbsp;The headquarters office is in a HubZone. A second office is in a non-HUBZone. The headquarters office has 2 employees. The second office has 3 employees.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The firm does not meet the principal office requirement because the greatest number of the concern's employees work at the non-HUBZone location.<br />\r\nDo the employees that work in the HUBZone office have to reside in a HUBZone? The answer is no. It is important to note:<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When dealing with the evaluation of the principal office - - - do not consider where employees live.<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When dealing with the evaluation of the 35% employee residency requirement - - - do not consider where employees work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 9 Is Your Business in a HUBZone?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Graphic - HUBZone Maps Tool - Link -</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative<br />\r\nOK…. So how do you know if your firm or employees are located in a designated HUBZone area?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA has created an electronic tool where you can insert the address and zip code of a specific location (or its coordinates) to determine if that location is recognized as a designated HUBZone. HUBZones are determined by the government - using the most current census, unemployment and other data. This is a very helpful and important tool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At you convenience, return to this slide or the resource section at the end of the course and use the hyperlink to access the HUBZone Maps, page. This page will help you determine if your business location and employees are located within a HUBZone area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 10 Reflections Before You Apply</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Most successful HUBZone firms plan for their success<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Long-term and revolving strategies that define how to be and remain competitive<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Maintain principal office and 35% employee residency requirements<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Planning is everything</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative<br />\r\nThe HUBZone program is a powerful contracting initiative with many benefits to certified businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, it is only intended for qualified firms who are competitive and remain in compliance.<br />\r\nSBA has found that the most successful HUBZone firms are those who plan for their success. That is, they have a long-term and continuingly evolving strategy that defines and refines how to be and remain competitive in government contracting markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, successful HUBZone firms must be vigilant about principal office and residency requirements<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;which must always be maintained, but can change quickly. Firms without a strategy to maintain<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nprincipal office and 35% employee residency requirements can find themselves out of compliance and promptly decertified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Planning is everything….. Plan for your success as a HUBZone certified firm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 11 HUBZone Certification Application Process</strong><br />\r\nNarrative<br />\r\nThe application process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 12 Applying for HUBZone Certification</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;STEP 1. Verify eligibility compliance<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;STEP 2. Gather what you need (supporting documentation)<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;STEP 3. Review HUBZone Application Guide<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;STEP 4. Review and ask questions<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;STEP 5. Access SBA's General Login System (GLS)<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;STEP 6. Complete and submit the online HUBZone application<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;STEP 7. Submit requested supporting documentation</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative<br />\r\nIf you feel you are qualified and only when you are ready to apply - should you apply for HUBZone certification. The application process is not difficult. However, like any important application process it does require solid preparation, meaningful thought and a certain level of due diligence. It makes sense to do it right, the first time. No business wants to waste time and resources going through the motions and then not realizing what is expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, we recommend that seven steps be followed in the application process. They are: verify eligibility compliance; gather all information and documentation that you need; review the HUBZone application guide; review your documentation and ask questions; access SBA's General Login System - GLS; complete and submit the online HUBZone application; and finally, submit all requested supporting documentation to the SBA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of these steps is discussed in the following.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 13 Step 1 Verify Eligibility Requirements - Applying for HUBZone Certification</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Firm is a small business by SBA size standards http://www.sba.gov/content/am-i-small-business- concern<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Business is directly owned and controlled by at least 51% U.S. citizens or a community development corporation, an agricultural cooperative, or an Indian tribe<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Firm's principal office and at least 35% of its employees reside in a designated HUBZone<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Note: Different rules apply for Tribal Governments, Alaska Native Corporations, Community Development Corporations and small agricultural cooperatives<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Learn more… Eligibility Requirements 13-CFR-126 - http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text- idx?c=ecfr;sid=8e50efb90b1e9a6628c364627eb148cb;rgn=div5;view=text;node=13:1.0.1.1.21;id no=13;cc=ecfr</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative<br />\r\nNot every business is eligible for the HUBZone program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before you begin the application process, make sure you meet core eligibility requirements. &nbsp;That is:<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;verify that your firm is a small business by SBA standards;<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;confirm ownership and control, such that the business is directly owned and controlled by at least 51% U.S. citizens or a community development corporation, an agricultural cooperative, or an Indian tribe; and,<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;make certain the firm's principal office is, and at least 35% of its employees reside in a designated HUBZone.<br />\r\nAs mentioned earlier, different rules apply for Tribal Governments, Alaska Native Corporations, Community Development Corporations and small agricultural cooperatives.

Therefore, it's important to assemble key business, ownership, tax and other pertinent information to have readily available during the application process and BEFORE you attempt to complete the online HUBZone application.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nSuch information at a minimum, should include: general business information, SAM profile data, DUNS number, appropriate NAICS codes, recent business tax returns, personal federal tax returns for principals, proof of principal office location, such as a lease agreement, citizen documentation for owners, ownership documentation, such as articles of incorporation or LLC agreement, official payroll records and other information that can demonstrate employees' living within designated HUBZones and other basic information that supports HUBZone eligibility requirements. Use the hyperlinked - document request checklist - to better understand what supporting documentation will be requested by the SBA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 15 Step 3 Review the HUBZone Application Guide</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Review the HUBZone Application Guide<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Critical Step - do not attempt to complete the actual online HUBZone application until you have reviewed the sample form and gathered all documents you need to complete it</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative<br />\r\nStep 3 is critical. &nbsp;Review the HUBZone Application Guide. &nbsp;The guide is important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do not attempt to complete the actual online HUBZone application until you have reviewed the guide and gathered all documents you need to complete it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 16 Step 4 Review and Ask Questions</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applying for HUBZone Certification<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You don't know what you don't know…<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Review HUBZone eligibility requirements, sample application form and the documentation you gathered and ask questions<br />\r\nHUBZone Help Desk… HUBZone@sba.gov</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative<br />\r\nAs mentioned earlier, no business wants to waste time and resources going through the motions and then not getting what is expected. &nbsp;That is why Step 4 is particularly important.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember, you don't know what you don't know. Make a point of becoming informed. Carefully review HUBZone eligibility requirements, the sample application form and the supporting documentation you gathered, and then importantly, ask questions of SBA HUBZone staff and others qualified in the HUBZone program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is also a good time to review and update your firm's CCR and Dynamic Small Business Search or DSBS profiles. The information in these profiles must be consistent throughout the firm's documentation. &nbsp;Again, review and ask questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 17 Step 5 Access SBA's General Login System</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applying for HUBZone Certification Graphic - SBA GLS page<br />\r\nRegister for a GLS Account https://eweb.sba.gov/gls/dsp_addcustomer.cfm?imappsystypnm=8ASDB</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative<br />\r\nTo apply for HUBZone certification, you must register for an account in SBA's General Log-in System, more commonly referred to as GLS. The GLS system provides a single log-in point for all SBA services. This streamlines and simplifies service delivery to our clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is easy to register for an account, if you don't already have a GLS account. Once you register and establish a GLS ID and password, keep this information in a safe and readily available place. It is also important to note, that you will have to update your password every 90 days.<br />\r\nTo access the online HUBZone application, you will first have to login to SBA's GLS system. Slide 18 Step 6 Submit Online HUBZone Application Applying for HUBZone Certification<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Complete and submit the online HUBZone application<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click here… Apply to the HUBZone Program https://eweb1sp.sba.gov/hubzone/internet/general/dsp_enter_application.cfm?null=12368672 64012</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative<br />\r\nOK, so after you've determined that your firm is eligible, looked at the application guide, gathered the information and documentation you need, updated the firm's SAM and DSBS profiles and obtained a GLS login ID and password - you are now ready to complete and submit the online application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The application is comprehensive and includes multiple sections. Some sections can be completed in a few minutes, while others will take longer. However, it is important to note that each section once accessed will time-out in one hour, if the section is not completed in the time frame. If that happens, all information entered up to that point is lost and the application has to be started over.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Therefore, access the HUBZone application only after you have completed Steps 1-5 and you are ready to apply.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 19 Step 7 Submit Requested Documentation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applying for HUBZone Certification<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After application is submitted and reviewed, supporting documents will be requested by the SBA<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Documents must be provided to the SBA within two weeks<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Requested documents will include:<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Documentation supporting ownership &amp; control and size standards<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Business and personal tax returns<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Documents showing compliance with HUBZone employment and principal office requirements</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nOnce your HUBZone application is submitted online, SBA will review it and, if its complete and accepted, request documentation to support your application. The request will come in the form of an e-mail and will request specific documents. &nbsp;You will have two weeks to fulfill the document request.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Requested documents will include: documentation supporting ownership and control and size standards requirements; business and personal tax returns; and, documents showing compliance with HUBZone employment and principal office requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 20 Avoid Common Mistakes</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Application \"times-out\"<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;35% of employees are not located within HUBZone areas<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Requested supporting documents do not validate information in the HUBZone application<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SAM profile is not up to date</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative<br />\r\nSome common mistakes in the HUBZone application process can be easily avoided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure you have all required information before completing the online application - so it doesn't time out. Make certain 35% of employees are located within HUBZone areas. Importantly, make sure requested supporting documents can validate information entered in the application; for example, you will be asked to provide evidence of the HUBZone residency for each employee. Also, make certain your SAM profile is current. In other words, make sure you follow the steps recommended in this training module.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 21 Resources and Tools Narrative</strong><br />\r\nResources and tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 22 Resources and Tools</strong><br />\r\nHUBZone Maps &nbsp;http://map.sba.gov/hubzone/maps/<br />\r\nSBA District Offices http://www.sba.gov/about-offices-list/2<br />\r\nSample HUBZone Application http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/files/sample_HUB_Application.pdf Electronic HUBZone Application https://eweb1sp.sba.gov/hubzone/internet/general/dsp_enter_application.cfm?null=1236867264012 GLS Registration https://eweb.sba.gov/gls/dsp_addcustomer.cfm?imappsystypnm=8ASDB<br />\r\nSCORE http://www.score.org/chapters-map<br />\r\n13 CFR - Part -126 http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text- idx?c=ecfr;sid=8e50efb90b1e9a6628c364627eb148cb;rgn=div5;view=text;node=13:1.0.1.1.21;idno=13;c c=ecfr<br />\r\nSmall Business Development Centers (SBDC) http://www.asbdc-us.org/<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nProcurement Technical Assistance Centers (PTAC) http://www.aptac- us.org/new/Govt_Contracting/find.php<br />\r\nSBA Size Standards &nbsp;http://www.sba.gov/content/am-i-small-business-concern<br />\r\nSupporting Documentation http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/hubzone_request_for_doc.pdf HUBZone Certification &nbsp;http://www.sba.gov/hubzone</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative<br />\r\nInformation is power.

This provision of the law is known as the Women-Owned Small Business Federal Contract Program or simply, the WOSB program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new program creates contract opportunities for women entrepreneurs.<br />\r\nThis guide will help you understand the WOSB program and walk you through the necessary steps to be a participant in the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 3 Program Purpose</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Helps more women owned businesses win federal contracts<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Assist federal agencies to meet statutorily established 5% government-wide contracting goals for women owned small businesses</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative<br />\r\nThe program is designed to help more women owned small businesses to win federal contracts by providing a level playing field for WOSBs to compete. It is also intended to help federal agencies to meet contracting goals for women owned small businesses.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThat is, in accordance with legislatively established government-wide contracting goals, federal agencies are suppose to award at least 5% of all prime contract dollars awarded each year to women-owned small businesses. &nbsp;This program helps agencies achieve the women's contracting goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 4 Regulatory Guidance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Women Owned Small Business (WOSB) Program…</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Established by:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Section 8(m) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637 (m))</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Governed by:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>13 CFR Part 127</li>\r\n\t\t<li>FAR Subpart 19.15</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Women Owned Small Business Program was established by Section 8(m) of the Small Business Act.

The women-owned small business program is defined by several key tenets: the program applies only to contracts in designated industries; only women-owned small businesses or economically disadvantaged women-owned small businesses are eligible; competition is required for WOSB contract awards; and, participating women- owned small businesses are required to self certify, or optionally use a third party certifier.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nEach of these provisions is discussed in the following.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 6 Only Designated Industries</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Only contract requirements in industries designated by the SBA as underrepresented or substantially underrepresented are eligible for set-asides under the WOSB program</li>\r\n\t<li>Over 300 six-digit industry codes are eligible</li>\r\n\t<li>View designated industries by applicable NAICS codes… www.sba.gov/wosb</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only contract requirements in industries designated by the SBA as underrepresented or substantially underrepresented are eligible for set asides under the new women's program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use the hyperlink at your convenience to view eligible industries by applicable NAICS codes. Remember, and this is important, only designated industries are eligible for the WOSB program.

The ownership must be direct and not subject to conditions. A woman or women must manage the day to day operations of the business and be able to provide documents demonstrating that these requirements are satisfied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the business must be at or below the small business size standard for the primary NAICS code, the NAICS code assigned to the solicitation, and the contract for which it submits an offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 9 Eligibility - EDWOSB</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>EDWOSB…</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Own at least 51% of business and satisfy all conditions for a WOSB</li>\r\n\t<li>Personal net worth of less than $750,000</li>\r\n\t<li>Adjusted annual income of $350,000 or less</li>\r\n\t<li>Market value of all assets does not exceed $6 million (including business value and primary residence)</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn more… www.sba.gov/wosb</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An economically disadvantaged woman-owned small business must own at least 51% of the business and satisfy all conditions for a WOSB.

This is an important concept to understand. &nbsp;The WOSB program is not an SBA certification program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Self certification and third party certification are discussed in the following.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 13 WOSB Certification - Important Clarifications</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>SBA does not certify firms into the WOSB program, like it does for the 8(a) Business Development and HUBZone programs</li>\r\n\t<li>A women owned small business may self-certify and upload certain corporate documents into the WOSB repository or optionally use an SBA approved third-party certifier</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn more (compliance guide)… http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/files/WOSB%20Compliance%20Guide_April2011.pdf</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, there are some important clarifications that should be considered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, SBA does not certify companies into the WOSB program, like it does for the 8(a) Business Development or HUBZone programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The WOSB program is somewhat of a hybrid certification program. That is, a business is required to self- certify and upload certain corporate documents into the WOSB repository, or as an option, be certified by a third party certifier, approved by the SBA. &nbsp;This is an important point. &nbsp;SBA does not certify firms into the WOSB program, nor does it provide any formal notification regarding certification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also important to note, SBA will accept certifications of 8(a) certified business development participants, as long as the 8(a) firm is 51% owned and controlled by one or more women and the business is currently in the 8(a) Business Development Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 14 Self Certification</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Self certification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 15 Self Certification</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>WOSBs or EDWOSBs can self certify</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Register in the SAM</li>\r\n\t<li>Access SBA's General Login System (GLS)</li>\r\n\t<li>Complete the WOSB/EDWOSB program certification form</li>\r\n\t<li>Submit documents to the WOSB program repository</li>\r\n\t<li>Submit other documents as requested</li>\r\n\t<li>Represent WOSB status in SAM</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Learn more (compliance guide)… http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/files/WOSB%20Compliance%20Guide_April2011.pdf</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nA woman-owned small business or economically disadvantaged woman-owned small business can self certify -- to participate in the WOSB program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several key steps that need to be followed. First, register in the SAM; access SBA's General Login System (GLS); complete the WOSB/EDWOSB program certification form; submit documents to the WOSB program repository; submit other documents as requested; and finally, represent the firm's WOSB status in SAM. &nbsp;Each of these steps is discussed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 16 Register in the SAM</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Register in the System for Award Management (SAM)</li>\r\n\t<li>Expand SAM profile data -- in the Dynamic Small Business Search DSBS database</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn more (compliance guide)… http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/files/WOSB%20Compliance%20Guide_April2011.pdf</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first step in doing business with the federal government and self-certifying in the WOSB program is registering in the System for Award Management, more commonly referred to as SAM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SAM is an online government-maintained database of companies wanting to do business with the federal government. It is also used as a site to collect and house secure financial data for each registrant and is used by agencies to make contract payments to a contractor's bank account through electronic funds transfer. &nbsp;Importantly, agencies search the SAM database for prospective vendors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Small business data entered into SAM is automatically uploaded into the Dynamic Small Business Search database page, or DSBS. However, small firms have an option to include additional information in the DSBS. Creating a complete and wining profile in SAM and DSBS, helps provide expanded access to federal contracting opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 17 Access SBA's General Login System</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Screen shot and link to register for a GLS account… https://eweb.sba.gov/gls/dsp_addcustomer.cfm?imappsystypnm=8ASDB</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn more… www.sba.gov/wosb</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To apply for WOSB certification, you must register for an account in SBA's General Log-in System, more commonly referred to as GLS. The GLS system provides a single log-in point for all SBA services. This streamlines and simplifies service delivery to our clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is easy to register for an account, if you don't already have a GLS account. Once you register and establish a GLS ID and password, keep this information in a safe and readily available place. It is also important to note, that you will have to update your password every 90 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To upload required documents for WOSB certification, you will first have to login to SBA's GLS system. If you do not already have a GLS account, you can use the hyperlink on this page or in the resource section<br />\r\n-- at the end of the course -- to register for a GLS account. Uploading documents to the WOSB program repository is discussed fully later in the course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By-the-way, an excellent source of information about gaining GLS access is contained in a training presentation that you can access at sba.gov/wosb. Go to the section under \"getting started\" and click on the training presentation and then go to the part titled, User Guide for GLS and WOSB Repository.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 18 Complete WOSB/EDWOSB Certification Form</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>One of the most important documents to be completed by WOSB program participants is the WOSB Program Certification Form</li>\r\n\t<li>Two forms: (you must use appropriate form)\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>WOSB Program Certification - WOSBs -- http://www.sba.gov/content/women-owned- small-business-wosb-program-certification</li>\r\n\t\t<li>WOSB Program Certification - EDWOSBs -- http://www.sba.gov/content/women- owned-small-business-wosb-program-certification-edwosbs</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Personal Financial Statement (SBA Form 413)-- http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/tools_sbf_finasst413.pdf</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn more (compliance guide)… http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/files/WOSB%20Compliance%20Guide_April2011.pdf</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most important documents to be completed by WOSB program participants is the WOSB Program Certification form. Please note there are two forms, one for WOSBs and a slightly different form for EDWOSBs. &nbsp;You must complete the appropriate form.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All women owned small businesses and economically disadvantaged women owned small businesses that are interested in submitting an offer on a solicitation that has been set aside for WOSBs under the WOSB program must complete this certification prior to submitting the offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, this includes checking all of the boxes in the form and having an authorized officer of the WOSB sign and date the certification. Once the certification is complete, you must upload it to the WOSB program repository along with all other required documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, economically disadvantaged women owned small businesses are required to complete and upload to the repository, SBA Form 413, Personal Financial Statement, for each woman claiming economic disadvantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 19 Submit Required Documents to the WOSB Program Repository</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Copies of birth certificates, naturalization papers, or unexpired passports for owners who are women</li>\r\n\t<li>Copy of the joint venture agreement, if applicable</li>\r\n\t<li>For limited liability companies:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Articles of organization (also referred to as certificate of organization or articles of formation) and any amendments; and operating agreement, as well as any amendments</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>For corporations:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Articles of incorporation and any amendments; by-laws and any amendments; all issued stock certificates, including the front and back copies, signed in accordance with the by- laws; stock ledger; and voting agreements, if any</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>For partnerships,\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Partnership agreement and any amendments; and, the assumed/fictitious name (doing business as) certificate</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the WOSB program certification form, other documents are required to be uploaded into the WOSB Program Repository. &nbsp;For self certification, the following documents are required:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Copies of birth certificates, naturalization papers, or unexpired passports for owners who are women;</li>\r\n\t<li>A copy of the joint venture agreement, if applicable;</li>\r\n\t<li>For limited liability companies:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Articles of organization and any amendments; any operating agreements, as well as any amendments.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>For corporations: Articles of incorporation and any amendments; by-laws and any amendments; all issued stock certificates, including the front and back copies, signed in accordance with the by-laws; stock ledger; and voting agreements, if any.</li>\r\n\t<li>For partnerships: Partnership agreement and any amendments; and, the fictitious name -- or doing business as -- certificate.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 20 Submit Other Documents as Requested</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>It is possible that other documents are requested</li>\r\n\t<li>Don't be alarmed</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn more (compliance guide)… http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/files/WOSB%20Compliance%20Guide_April2011.pdf</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So….. you registered in SAM, you have a GLS account and login, you completed and uploaded the WOSB Program Certification form and you uploaded all of the required corporate documents, what's next?<br />\r\nWell, it's possible that other documentation may be requested by the SBA.

SBA maintains a list of approved third party certifiers on its Website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At present, there are four approved third party certifiers.

It is a document repository maintained by SBA to house documents submitted by EDWOSBs and WOSBs - validating the firm's eligibility in the WOSB program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The repository is a secure, web-based environment that is accessible to individual WOSBs and EDWOSBs, applicable contracting officers and the SBA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contracting officers, prior to the award of a contract under the WOSB program, will access the repository to review the documentation submitted by the potential WOSB vendor. In such cases, the WOSB firm will authorize the contracting officer to review the documentation. The contracting officer is required to validate the firm's eligibility in the WOSB program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, an excellent source of information about the repository is contained in a training presentation that you can access at sba.gov/wosb.

For purposes in this training module, the terms tribally owned business or tribally owned enterprise are used interchangeably with the term tribally owned concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As defined in federal regulations, a tribally owned business (concern) means any business (concern) that is at least 51% owned by an Indian tribe. An Indian tribe is any Indian tribe, band, nation or other organized group or community of Indians, including any ANC, which is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians or is recognized as such by the State in which the tribe, band, nation or community resides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slide 5 Business Development Growth</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business growth graphic…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 8(a) program is a tool, a business development tool that may fit within the economic development vision of the tribe or the tribal entities that make up the tribe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With that said, successful business development within a tribe may be enhanced with a well- defined economic development framework and a strong foundational base of capabilities, strategies and supporting policies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the base sits nation building. A strong, effective, self-driven nation serves as the foundation to support all productive activity. Resting above it, is economic development. In this level, a nation builds the capacity to identify, select and manage the community's endowment of resources and talent that help achieve the community's vision.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the top is business development growth. Here tribal entities make critical decisions on starting and growing their businesses. The 8(a) program is but one tool that may help support business development growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 6 Framework for Business Development Growth</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Assess<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What we know<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Strategic choices<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Identify opportunities<br />\r\n&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Capabilities<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Alignment and delivery<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Action<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Adapting and learning<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mobilization<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Willingness to lead change</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Achieving business growth requires a plan. &nbsp;A well thought out plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As such, a tribe should have a good understanding of where it is today, where it has been and where it wants to go. &nbsp;Five steps can be applied to build a planning framework. &nbsp;First, gather what you know and assess your current circumstances. Second, identify opportunities and make strategic choices. &nbsp;Applying to the 8(a) program, for instance, may be one of those choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Third, understand your tribal capabilities and align skills with what your tribe can successfully deliver. &nbsp;Fourth, identify and manage actions and lastly, but most importantly, mobilize change.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 7 Structural Options</strong><br />\r\nGraphic of business structural options…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 8(a) program is a tool. &nbsp;And, a tribe may have more than one 8(a) tribal enterprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important for a tribe to understand how it can be optimally structured so it can be positioned for business development growth. This slide shows one structural option, with two affiliated 8(a) firms. &nbsp;There are other options.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At your convenience, review the hyperlinked guides to better understand how a tribe can be positioned for growth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 8 Reflection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does your tribe have a strong foundational base for economic development? Has tribal leadership considered ways the 8(a) program can be used as a business development tool? Is your tribe structurally positioned for optimal business development growth?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 9 8(a) Program &amp; Summary Program</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 10 Program Purpose</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Help small disadvantaged businesses, including tribally owned businesses compete in the marketplace</li>\r\n\t<li>Provide business development support</li>\r\n\t<li>Prepare qualifying entities for procurement and other business opportunities</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The 8(a) Program -- named for Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act - is designed to assist small disadvantaged businesses, including tribally owned businesses to compete in the marketplace. It is also designed to assist such entities in gaining access to federal and private procurement markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The primary focus of the program is to provide business development support, such as mentoring, procurement assistance, business counseling, training, financial assistance, surety bonding and other management and technical assistance to qualified firms. The ultimate objective, however, is to prepare small disadvantaged firms for procurement and other business opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Through the award of sole source and set-aside contracts, the 8(a) program provides market access and growth for qualified tribal enterprises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 11 American Indian 8(a) Perspective</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>8(a) program is a business development tool for American Indian tribes</li>\r\n\t<li>Federal agencies have strong incentives to contract with tribal concerns</li>\r\n\t<li>Tribes do have special procurement privileges - an important perspective is that often times proceeds from tribally owned companies are used to benefit the entire tribal membership, rather than individual owners</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The program is a business development tool that offers opportunities for American Indian tribes. Under the 8(a) program, Congress granted tribes with unique rights in the federal procurement process. These rights provide federal agencies with strong incentives to contract with tribal enterprises.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tribes do have special procurement privileges. There are many reasons for this. However, an important perspective is that often times the proceeds from tribally owned companies are used for the benefit of the entire tribal membership, rather than individual owners. Tribes use these proceeds to build, sustain and operate their communities - for the betterment of education, health care, public works and other community sustaining activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 12 Regulatory Guidance</strong><br />\r\nThe 8(a) Business Development Program:<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Established by:<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act of 1953<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Governed by:<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;13 CFR 124.100-124.704 (Subpart A)<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;FAR Part 19.800-19.812<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Specific References to Tribally Owned Businesses:<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;13 CFR 124.3 -- Definitions<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;13 CFR 124.103 -- Who is Socially disadvantaged?<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;13 CFR 124.105-106 -- Eligibility<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;13 CFR 124.109 -- Applying to the 8(a) program<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;13 CFR 124.112 -- Business criteria to remain eligible</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 8(a) program was established by Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nIt is primarily governed by 13 CFR 124 Subpart A and FAR Parts 19.8 - 19.812.

The last five years in the program are considered the transitional stage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuation in the program, in both the developmental and transitional stages, is dependent on the firm's continuing eligibility as a socially and economically disadvantaged - owned and operated - firm and that the firm continues to be in compliance with the 8(a) business development agreement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 15 Summary Requirements and Goals</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Overall goal for 8(a) firms is to graduate from the program and thrive in a competitive business environment</li>\r\n\t<li>Requirements:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Maintain a balance between commercial and government business</li>\r\n\t\t<li>SBA district offices monitor and measure the progress of participating firms</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Annual review</li>\r\n\t<li>Business planning</li>\r\n\t<li>Systematic evaluations</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The 8(a) program is a business development program. As such, the overall goal for 8(a) firms is to graduate from the program and go-on to thrive in a competitive business environment. There are several requirements in place to help firms achieve this goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Firms must maintain a balance between their commercial and government business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, SBA district offices monitor and measure the progress of participating 8(a) firms. It does this through annual reviews, business planning collaboration and systematic evaluations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 16 Reflection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is the purpose of the 8(a) program aligned with the goals and objectives of your tribe?

SBA plays a pivotal role, but the core of the program is focused on business development assistance, business development support, finding contract opportunities and marketing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important role, however, is played by 8(a) firms themselves. Each of these components is explained in the following sections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 19 SBA's Role</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Program policy guidance</li>\r\n\t<li>Review and certify eligible clients</li>\r\n\t<li>Assign SBA personnel, Business Opportunity Specialists, to 8(a) participating firms</li>\r\n\t<li>Provide business development assistance</li>\r\n\t<li>Help identify contract opportunities for 8(a) participating entities</li>\r\n\t<li>Review progress of 8(a) certified businesses and tribal concerns</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>As the administrator of the program, SBA provides program policy guidance, reviews and certifies eligible clients, assigns SBA personnel -- Business Opportunity Specialists -- to approved 8(a) entities, provides business development assistance, helps in identifying potential contract opportunities and reviews the progress of participating 8(a) concerns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA's role is to build a strong resource-rich program -- that helps 8(a) tribal enterprises to become and remain competitive in the economic mainstream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 20 Business Development Assistance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Business counseling and mentoring</li>\r\n\t<li>Online and traditional training</li>\r\n\t<li>Surety bond guarantees</li>\r\n\t<li>Contract marketing guidance</li>\r\n\t<li>Able to acquire federal government surplus property</li>\r\n\t<li>Other management and technical assistance</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Aiding 8(a) tribal enterprises with business development assistance is core to the program. This assistance takes many forms, but includes, business counseling and mentoring; online and traditional training; surety bond guarantees; contract marketing guidance; acquire federal government surplus property; and, other forms of management and technical assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Competitive strength comes from knowledge, financial support and technical assistance - all of which can be gained through SBA's business development initiatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 21 Business Development Support</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Helping firms:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>register in the System for Award Management (SAM)</li>\r\n\t\t<li>find contract opportunities</li>\r\n\t\t<li>maintain a current business plan with a procurement strategy</li>\r\n\t\t<li>and other support</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>Working with agencies and prime contractors to direct contracts to small firms</li>\r\n\t<li>Assigning Business Opportunity Specialists(BOS)s to work individually with participating 8(a) firms</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Providing management, technical and financial assistance is one aspect of the program. Another key dimension is providing business development support to 8(a) clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This SBA support is varied and can include: helping 8(a) program clients register in the System for Award Management or SAM --- which is a national database of firms seeking to do business with the federal government as well as prime contractors. SBA will also help firms to understand and use government tools to find contract opportunities, assists clients in developing and maintaining a current business plan with a defined procurement strategy, and provides assistance in many other ways. &nbsp;This assistance can be beneficial to a tribal business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Importantly, SBA also works with federal agencies and prime contractors ---- encouraging them to set aside, breakout or otherwise make contracts available to 8(a) and other small firms. In other words, SBA markets the technical capabilities of small businesses to federal buying entities.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nIn addition, each 8(a) firm is assigned a Business Opportunity Specialist by the SBA. The assigned specialist helps guide the 8(a) business during its tenure in the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 22 Contract Opportunities</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>SBA staff and Procurement Center Representatives (PCRs) work closely with government and private organizations to identify procurement opportunities for small firms</li>\r\n\t<li>Government-wide procurement goals that benefit small businesses\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>23% -- Overall small business goal</li>\r\n\t\t<li>5% -- Small disadvantaged businesses</li>\r\n\t\t<li>5% -- Women owned small businesses</li>\r\n\t\t<li>3% -- Certified HUBZone firms</li>\r\n\t\t<li>3% -- Service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The federal government buys in excess of $600 billion dollars in goods and services each year. Government-wide procurement goals help define another aspect of the 8(a) program. Such goals establish procurement targets for agencies that benefit small disadvantaged businesses and other small firms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA personnel, specifically Procurement Center Representatives, work closely with government and private organizations to identify procurement opportunities for small businesses and to help target specific acquisitions for 8(a) participating firms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, government policy and SBA staff encourage federal agencies to meet or exceed annual small business procurement goals. The current government-wide goal for prime and subcontracts to small disadvantaged businesses is 5%. Overall, however, the government-wide small business goal for all prime contracts is 23%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other government-wide procurement goals include: 5 percent of prime and subcontracts for women-owned small businesses; 3 percent of prime and subcontracts for Hubzone businesses and &nbsp;3 percent of prime and subcontracts for service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 23 Role of 8(a) Tribal Businesses</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>SBA opens the door….</li>\r\n\t<li>8(a) client firms must be competitive and market themselves competitively</li>\r\n\t<li>Successful 8(a)tribal firms capitalize on available business development resources, educate themselves on government buying needs, and market themselves based on skills and ability to meet such needs</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, in describing how the program works, the most important role is played by the 8(a) firms, themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SBA may be able to open some doors, but it is up to the tribal 8(a) firms in the program to be competitive and to market themselves effectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's all about preparation and self-marketing. Successful 8(a) firms capitalize on available business development resources, educate themselves on government and corporate buying needs, and market themselves based on their skills and ability to support the procurement needs of multiple organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 24 Reflection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Can the 8(a) program be used successfully by your tribe as a business development tool?

If the waiver language, however is not included in the documentation, the firm will be denied admission into the 8(a) program.<br />\r\nAlso, the tribal enterprise must be organized for profit, and the tribe must possess economic development powers in the tribe's governing documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 34 Size</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tribally owned applicant must qualify as a small business and certify as such to the SBA, pursuant to the provisions in 13 CFR 121<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In determining the small business size standard, the Indian tribe - or wholly owned business of the tribe - will be determined independently without regard to its affiliation with the tribe, any entity of the tribal government or any other business enterprise owned by the tribe</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Business size matters.

That is, management may be provided by non-tribal members if SBA determines that such management is required to assist the firm's development. In such cases, the tribe must retain control of all management decisions common to boards of directors, including strategic planning, budget approval, and the employment and compensation of business officers. In addition, a plan must be in place to demonstrate how tribal members can grow in managerial skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is an important element in the eligibility and application process. Use the regulatory site noted in the slide to gain additional clarity regarding this matter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 37 Individual Eligibility Limitation</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Individual eligibility limitation - there is none<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SBA does not deem an individual involved in the management or daily business operations of a tribally owned business to have used his or her individual eligibility within the meaning of \"one-time eligibility\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no individual eligibility limitation. That is, SBA does not deem an individual involved in the management or daily business operations of a tribally-owned business to have used his or her individual eligibility within the meaning of \"one-time eligibility,\" as described in 13 CFR 124.108(b).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 38 Potential for Success</strong><br />\r\nA Tribally-owned concern may establish potential for success by demonstrating that:<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;it has been in business for at least two years, as evidenced by income tax returns for each of the two previous tax years showing operating revenues in the primary industry in which the applicant is seeking 8(a) certification; or<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;the individual or individuals who will manage and control the daily business operations of the firm have substantial technical and management experience, the applicant has a record of successful performance on contracts from governmental or nongovernmental sources in its primary industry category, and the applicant has adequate capital to sustain its operations and carry out its business plan as a Participant; or<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;the tribe has made a firm written commitment to support the operations of the applicant concern and it has the financial ability to do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 39 Other Eligibility Criteria</strong><br />\r\nTribally owned applicant may not be denied admission into the program due solely to a determination that specific contract opportunities are unavailable to assist the development of the applicant firm, unless:<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Government has not previously procured and is unlikely to procure the types of products or services offered by the concern<br />\r\n&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Purchase of such products or services by the government will not be in quantities sufficient to support the developmental needs of the applicant and other program participants providing the same or similar items or services</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As with other 8(a) applicants, a tribally owned applicant may not be denied admission into the program due solely to a determination that specific contract opportunities are unavailable to assist the development of the applicant firm, unless: the government has not previously procured and is unlikely to procure the types of products or services offered by the concern; or the purchase of such products or services by the government will not be in quantities sufficient to support the developmental needs of the applicant and other program participants providing the same or similar items or services.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 40 Reflection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Does your tribe and the tribal business or businesses within the tribe meet the eligibility requirements of the 8(a) program?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 41 Application Process The application process.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 42 Applying to the 8(a) BD Program</strong><br />\r\nSTEP 1. Verify tribal eligibility compliance<br />\r\nSTEP 2. Gather what you need (supporting documentation)<br />\r\nSTEP 3. Ask questions<br />\r\nSTEP 4. Register in the System for Award Management (SAM)<br />\r\nSTEP 5. Register in SBA's General Login System (GLS)<br />\r\nSTEP 6. Complete and submit the online 8(a) program application</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you feel you are qualified and only when you are ready to apply - should you apply for 8(a) program certification.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The application process is not difficult. However, like any important application process it does require solid preparation, meaningful thought and a certain level of due diligence. &nbsp;It makes sense to do it right, the first time. No business wants to waste time and resources going through the motions and then not realizing what is expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, we recommend that six steps be followed in the application process. Each of these steps is discussed in the following.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 43 Step 1 Verify Tribal Eligibility Compliance</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before you begin the application process, verify tribal eligibility requirements:<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Must be able to demonstrate social disadvantage as a tribal entity<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tribe must be able to show economic disadvantage<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Tribal business must meet legal, size, ownership, character, management &amp; control and potential for success standards<br />\r\n&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Carefully review 13 CFR 124.109(b) and 13 CFR 124.109(c)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not every business enterprise is eligible for 8(a) program certification. Before you begin the application process, make sure you meet the core tribal eligibility requirements. &nbsp;This is step one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 44 Step 2 Gather What You Need Learn more about…</strong><br />\r\nTribally Owned Business Checklist Sample 8(a) Program Application</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The 8(a) program is statutorily authorized and specific eligibility requirements are strictly adhered-to and monitored by the SBA.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you prepare to apply for 8(a) program certification, you will be asked to provide, identify, demonstrate and validate much information. Therefore, it's important to assemble key tribal, business, governance, ownership, tax and other pertinent information to have readily available during the application process and BEFORE you attempt to complete the electronic 8(a) program application. &nbsp;This is step two.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 45 Step 3 Ask Questions</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;You don't know what you don't know…<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Review eligibility requirements, checklist, blank 8(a) program application, documentation you gathered and then --- ASK QUESTIONS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned earlier, no business wants to waste time and resources going through the motions and then not getting what is expected. &nbsp;That is why step three is critical.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You don't know what you don't know. Make a point of becoming informed. Review eligibility requirements, the checklist, blank 8(a) application, documentation you gathered, and then, importantly, ask questions of SBA district office staff and others, experienced and qualified in the 8(a) program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 46 Step 4 Register in SAM</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learn more about…<br />\r\nSystem for Award Management (SAM)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step four, register in the System for Award Management.<br />\r\nTo do business with the federal government and to be certified under the 8(a) program, you must register in the System for Award Management or SAM, which is a database and government- wide single point of vendor registration. Within the SAM system, you must also complete the Small Business Supplemental Page. Use the hyperlink to learn more about the SAM system and to register your tribal business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 47 Step 5 Access and Register in GLS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Step five, access and register in the General Login System.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nTo apply for 8(a) certification, you must register for an account in SBA's General Log-in System, more commonly referred to as GLS. The GLS system provides a single log-in point for all SBA services. This single-entry point streamlines and simplifies service delivery to our clients.<br />\r\nTo access the 8(a) program electronic application, you will first have to login to SBA's GLS system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 48 Step 6 Complete and Submit Application</strong><br />\r\nStep 6, complete and submit the 8(a) electronic application.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 49 Reflection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is your tribal business ready to apply for 8(a) certification? Have you meaningfully considered each of the six 8(a) program application steps?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 50 Key Questions and Answers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 51 FAQs Learn more… 13 CFR 124</strong><br />\r\nTribally Owned Businesses - FAQs 8(a) Program Certification - FAQs Acquire Surplus Property - FAQs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes the best approach to learn about a program is to review frequently asked questions and answers. Several good sources for such information include: 13 CFR 124 -- which is a comprehensive review of the 8(a) program and developed in a question and answer format; tribally owned Businesses FAQs; 8(a) program certification FAQs; and, FAQs about acquiring surplus property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 52 Reflection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Knowledge is power. Does your tribe know enough about the 8(a) program to consider using it as a business development tool for the tribe? Who are the other members of your tribe who could benefit from reviewing this training module about the 8(a) program?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 53 Resources and Tools</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 54 Resources and Tools</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Federal Acquisition Regulations<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;https://www.acquisition.gov/far<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Acquisition Central<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;https://www.acquisition.gov/<br />\r\n&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;FAR Part 19 - Small Business Programs<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.acquisition.gov/far<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;System for Award Management (SAM)<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;www.sam.gov<br />\r\nNumerous resources are available to assist tribal enterprises in learning more about and participating in the 8(a) Business Development Program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 55 Resources and Tools</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Federal Business Opportunities<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.fbo.gov<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SBA-Government Contracting<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.sba.gov/aboutsba/sbaprograms/gc/index.html<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Code of Federal Regulations (13CFR) (48 CFR)<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;http://www.gpoaccess.gov/cfr/index.html<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Learn more about:<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SBA Size Standards - http://www.sba.gov/category/navigation- structure/contracting/contracting-officials/eligibility-size-standards<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;8(a) Business Development Program - http://www.sba.gov/content/8a-business- development-0<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;WOSB Program - http://www.sba.gov/content/contracting-opportunities-women- owned-small-businesses<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;HUB Zone Program - http://www.sba.gov/content/hubzone-0<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Local (client) resources:<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SBA district office - http://www.sba.gov/localresources/index.html<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Procurement Technical Assistance Center (PTAC) - http://www.aptac- us.org/new/Govt_Contracting/find.php<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Government Contracting Classroom (free online courses) - http://www.sba.gov/gcclassroom<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SCORE chapter - http://www.score.org<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Small Business Development Center - http://www.asbdc-us.org/<br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SBA/SBDC Program Office - http://www.sba.gov/content/small-business- development-centers-sbdcs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use these resources to become better informed and improve your chances of being a successful tribal participant in the 8(a) program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 56 Find a Mentor</strong><br />\r\no&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SBA's Mentor-Protégé Program offers significant benefits to tribal 8(a) firms<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Technical and management assistance<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Prime contracting<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Financial assistance<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Qualification for other SBA programs</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And finally, a very helpful resource program for tribal 8(a) firms is SBA's Mentor-Protégé Program.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nThis relationship building resource-initiative is designed to enhance the capability of tribal and other 8(a) participants to compete more successfully for federal contracts. The program encourages 8(a) firms to partner with experienced contracting firms, serving as mentors.<br />\r\nUnder the program, 8(a) firms can gain significant benefits, including: technical and management assistance; prime contracting support; financial assistance in the form of equity or loans; and, qualification for other SBA programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 57 Reflection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How can businesses within your tribe use the Mentor Protégé Program to benefit the tribe's overall goals for business growth?

It is a training program designed for contracting officers and others interested in the WOSB program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 2 - WOSB Training Content</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>WOSB Program Overview</li>\r\n\t<li>WOSB Eligibility</li>\r\n\t<li>CO’s Checklist for Using the WOSB Program</li>\r\n\t<li>“Parity”</li>\r\n\t<li>Certification – Self Certification</li>\r\n\t<li>Required Documents</li>\r\n\t<li>WOSB Program Repository &amp; the Role of the Contracting Officer</li>\r\n\t<li>Reviews and Protests</li>\r\n\t<li>Resources and Questions</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The WOSB training program covers nine key topic areas and is designed to be a helpful resource for contracting officers. The course is indexed and structured so that any section of the course can be easily accessed at any time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 3 - Introduction</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Small Business Act authorizes contract set asides for WOSBs or EDWOSBs</li>\r\n\t<li>Defined as the Women-Owned Small Business Federal Contract Program</li>\r\n\t<li>Creates opportunities for women entrepreneurs Narrative</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The Small Business Act now authorizes federal contracting officers to set aside certain contracting requirements for women-owned small businesses and/or economically disadvantaged women-owned small businesses. This provision of the law is known as the Women-Owned Small Business Federal Contract Program or simply, the WOSB program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new program creates contract opportunities for women entrepreneurs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This guide provides an overview of WOSB program requirements, including the role and responsibilities of contracting officers with respect to the program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 4 - Program Purpose</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Help more women owned small businesses win federal contracts</li>\r\n\t<li>Assist federal agencies to meet statutorily established 5% government-wide contracting goals for women owned small businesses</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The program is designed to help more women owned small businesses win federal contracts. It is also intended to help federal agencies to meet contracting goals for women owned small businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is, in accordance with legislatively established government-wide contracting goals, federal agencies are suppose to award at least 5% of all prime contract dollars awarded each year to women-owned small businesses.&nbsp; This program helps agencies achieve the women’s contracting goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prior to the implementation of this program, contracting officers did not have a specific authority to set- aside acquisitions for women owned small businesses or economically disadvantaged women owned small businesses. Without a specific set-aside, agencies were having difficulty meeting the women’s contracting goal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Accordingly, a key purpose of this program is to help agencies meet the 5 percent women’s contracting goal and ensure a level playing field on which women owned small businesses can compete for federal contracting &nbsp;opportunities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 5 - WOSB Program (topic area) Narrative</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The WOSB program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 6 - WOSB Program Snapshot</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Set-asides must be in industries designated by SBA</li>\r\n\t<li>Requirements can be set-aside for WOSBs or EDWOSBs</li>\r\n\t<li>Competition is required for all WOSB and EDWOSB contracts</li>\r\n\t<li>WOSBs are required to self certify as a woman owned small business (or use a third party certifier)</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn more… View Compliance Guide -</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/files/WOSB%20Compliance%20Guide_April2011.pdf\">http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/files/W OSB%2 0Compliance%2 0Gui de_ April2 011.pdf</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The WOSB program can open new doors for women entrepreneurs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, not all contract opportunities are eligible and there are limitations. The women-owned small business program is defined by several key tenets: the program applies only to contracts in designated industries; requirements&nbsp; can only be set-aside for WOSBs or EDWOSBs; competition is required for WOSB and EDWOSB contract awards; and, participating women-owned small businesses are required to self certify, or optionally use a third party certifier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of these provisions is discussed in the following. Slide 7 - Only Designated Industries</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Only contract requirements in industries designated by the SBA as underrepresented or substantially underrepresented are eligible for set-asides under the WOSB program</li>\r\n\t<li>Over 300 six-digit industry codes are eligible</li>\r\n\t<li>View designated industries by NAICS codes – <a href=\"http://www.sba.gov/wosb\">http://www.sba.gov/wosb</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only contract requirements in industries designated by the SBA as underrepresented or substantially underrepresented are eligible for set asides under the women’s program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use the hyperlink to view eligible industries by applicable NAICS codes.&nbsp; Remember,&nbsp; and this is important, only designated industries are eligible for the WOSB program. Some industries – those designated as substantially underrepresented -- are eligible for women owned small business set-asides and others -- designated as just underrepresented -- are eligible for economically disadvantaged women owned small business set-asides.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 8 - Set-asides -WOSB</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A contracting officer may set-aside a requirement for women owned small business (WOSB) if:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The NAICS code assigned to the solicitation, invitation for bid, or quote is in an industry in which SBA has designated that WOSBs are substantially underrepresented</li>\r\n\t<li>Rule of two applies</li>\r\n\t<li>Anticipated award amount does not exceed contract limitations</li>\r\n\t<li>Contract can be awarded at a fair and reasonable price</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A contracting officer may set-aside a requirement for women owned small businesses if:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>the NAICS code assigned to the solicitation, invitation for bid, or quote is in an industry in which SBA has designated that WOSBs are substantially underrepresented;</li>\r\n\t<li>the contracting officer has a reasonable expectation that two or more WOSBs will submit offers; and,</li>\r\n\t<li>in the estimation of the contracting officer, the contract can be awarded at a fair and reasonable price.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 9 - Set-asides – EDWOSB</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A contracting officer may set-aside a requirement for economically disadvantaged women owned small businesses (EDWOSB) if:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The NAICS code assigned to the solicitation, invitation for bid, or quote is in an industry in which SBA has designated that WOSBs are underrepresented</li>\r\n\t<li>Rule of two applies</li>\r\n\t<li>Contract can be awarded at a fair and reasonable price</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A contracting officer may set-aside a requirement for economically disadvantaged women owned small businesses if:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>the NAICS code assigned to the solicitation, invitation for bid, or quote is in an industry in which SBA has designated that WOSBs are underrepresented;</li>\r\n\t<li>the contracting officer has a reasonable expectation that two or more WOSBs will submit offers; and,</li>\r\n\t<li>in the estimation of the contracting officer, the contract can be awarded at a fair and reasonable price.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 10 – NO Limitations on Contract Amounts</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>No restrictions on the dollar amounts for eligible WOSB contracts</li>\r\n\t<li>Revisions to the National Defense Authorization Act, which went into effect May 7, 2013, removed “caps” on contract amounts under the WOSB program</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the WOSB program was first established, there were restrictions on the dollar amounts for contracts eligible under the program. These limitations or “caps” on contract amounts were removed, effective May 7, 2013, as a result of amendments in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2013.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 11 – Competition is Required</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Competition is required</li>\r\n\t<li>Sole source awards are not authorized</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The WOSB program requires competition. Sole source awards are not authorized.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simply put, all contract awards under the WOSB program are required to be executed in a competitive manner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 12 - WOSBs Required to Self Certify (or use a third party certifier option)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Self certification</li>\r\n\t<li>Third party certification (option)</li>\r\n\t<li>Learn more… View Compliance Guide -</li>\r\n\t<li><a href=\"http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/files/WOSB%20Compliance%20Guide_April2011.pdf\">http://www.sba.gov/sites/default/files/files/W OSB%2 0Compliance%2 0Gui de_ April2 011.pdf</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Women business owners participating in the WOSB program are required to self certify – with documentation, or optionally use a third party certifier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Contracting officers are required to verify that the apparent successful offeror -- participating in a WOSB set-aside, prior to the award of the contract -- has filed proper documentation in the WOSB repository. This is an important aspect of the WOSB program. Self certification and contractor officer review of documentation are both further explained later in the training program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 13 - Important Clarification</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>SBA does not certify firms into the WOSB program, like it does for the 8(a) Business Development and HUBZone programs</li>\r\n\t<li>A women owned small business may self-certify and upload certain corporate documents into the WOSB repository or optionally use an SBA approved third-party certifier</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The WOSB program is not an SBA certification program. That is, SBA does not certify companies into the WOSB program, like it does for the 8(a) Business Development or HUBZone programs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The WOSB program is a hybrid certification program. A business is required to self -certify – with documentation, or as an option, be certified by a third party certifier, approved by the SBA. This is an important clarification.

FAR part 10 outlines how market research can be conducted. Generally, agencies use recent, past acquisition history and searches on the Dynamic Small Business Search engine to determine if small firms are available for an acquisition and determine if the rule of two applies. Importantly, review your market research to determine if the acquisition can in-fact be set-aside for WOSBs or EDWOSBs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you decide to do a WOSB or EDWOSB award, make certain that you notify potential offerors in the solicitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You must also verify that the apparent successful offeror is eligible for an award. To do this, you would check the WOSB program repository to make certain that all required documents – pertaining to WOSB certification – have been submitted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, you must properly document the file. This important step includes: outlining the market research you conducted; validating that the NAICS code for the award is designated by the SBA as underrepresented if for a EDWOSB set-aside or substantially underrepresented if for a WOSB award; and, documenting that you checked the ORCA representation and WOSB repository for the apparent successful offeror.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And finally, according to FAR 15.503, you must provide pre-award notification to unsuccessful offerors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 21 - “Parity” (topic area)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parity and the WOSB program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 22 - The Question of Parity</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Regarding parity, all small business programs are equal…</li>\r\n\t<li>SBA’s current regulations provide contracting officers with discretion to utilize <strong><em>either </em></strong>the 8(a) BD, SDVO SBC, HUBZone or WOSB programs – before the traditional small business set-aside</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Narrative</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parity is the term that is used to describe which small business program can be used for an acquisition.

This is an important step in the certification process and an aspect of the program where contracting officers play a critical role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By statute, documents verifying a WOSB’s or EDWOSB’s eligibility must be sent to the contracting officer. Rather than have documents sent directly to contracting officers, SBA has created a document warehouse, the WOSB program repository. Documents in the repository can only be accessed by the respective WOSB, SBA and the contracting officer – only if and when the WOSB firm authorizes the contracting officer to view the documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For firms that self certify, the contracting officer should look for the following required documents:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The WOSB or EDWOSB Program Certification form;</li>\r\n\t<li>Copies of birth certificates, naturalization papers, or unexpired passports for owners who are women;</li>\r\n\t<li>A copy of the joint venture agreement, if applicable;</li>\r\n\t<li>For limited liability companies:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Articles of organization and any amendments; any operating agreements, as well as any amendments.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>For corporations:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Articles of incorporation and any amendments; by-laws and any amendments;&nbsp; all issued stock certificates, including the front and back copies, signed in accordance with the by-laws; stock ledger; and voting agreements, if any.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>For partnerships:\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Partnership agreement and any amendments; and, the fictitious name -- or doing business as -- certificate.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition for EDWOSBs, contracting officers should look for a personal financial statement – SBA Form 413 – for each woman claiming economic disadvantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Slide 32 - Required Documents (third party certification)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Third Party Certification (from certifier)</li>\r\n\t<li>See require documents for self certification Narrative</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If a firm uses an approved third party certifier, much of the same documentation is required to be uploaded to the WOSB Program Repository – including a personal financial statement for each woman claiming economic disadvantage.
